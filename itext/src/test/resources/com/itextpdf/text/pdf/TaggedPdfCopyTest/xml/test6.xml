<P> (
&#194;	 If no Wi-Fi networks are available or you choose not to join any, iPhone connects to 
the Internet over a cellular data network or ). You cannot access the iTunes Wi-
Fi Music Store over a cellular network. </P>
<Sect><P>If no Wi-Fi networks are available and a cellular data network is not available, iPhone 
cannot connect to the Internet. Turning on airplane mode disables both Wi-Fi and 
cellular network access. </P>
<P>Note: Because iPhone uses the cellular network for the phone, you cannot use the 
Internet over a cellular network when you&#8217;re on a call. To talk on the phone and use 
Internet applications at the same time, connect over a Wi-Fi network. </P>
<P>Many Wi-Fi networks can be used free of charge including, in some regions, Wi-Fi 
hotspots provided by your iPhone carrier. Some Wi-Fi networks require a fee. To join a 
Wi-Fi network at a hotspot where charges apply, you can usually open Safari to see a 
webpage that allows you to sign up for service. </P>
<Sect><H3>Joining a Wi-Fi Network </H3>
<P>The Wi-Fi settings let you turn on Wi-Fi and join Wi-Fi networks. </P>
<P>Turn on Wi-Fi </P>
<P>Choose Settings &gt; Wi-Fi and turn Wi-Fi on. </P>
<P>Join a Wi-Fi network </P>
<P>Choose Settings &gt; Wi-Fi, wait a moment as iPhone detects networks in range, 
then select a network. If necessary, enter a password and tap Join (networks that 
require a password appear with a lock icon). </P>
<P>Once you&#8217;ve joined a Wi-Fi network manually, iPhone will automatically connect to it 
whenever the network is in range. If more than one previously used network is in 
range, iPhone joins the one last used. </P>
<P>When iPhone is connected to a Wi-Fi network, the Wi-Fi icon in the status bar at the 
top of the screen shows connection strength. The more bars you see, the stronger the 
connection. </P>

<Sect><H3>Accessing the Internet via Cellular Network </H3>
<P>EDGE and GPRS allow Internet connectivity over the cellular network available through 
your iPhone carrier&#8217;s wireless service. Check the carrier&#8217;s network coverage in your area 
for availability. </P>
<P>While iPhone is actively transferring data over a cellular network&#8212;downloading a 
webpage, for example&#8212;you may not be able to receive calls. Incoming calls then go 
directly to voicemail. </P>

<Sect><H3>Syncing iPhone with Your Computer </H3>
<P>When you connect iPhone to your computer, iTunes syncs iPhone with the information 
and media on your computer, according to how you&#8217;ve configured the iPhone sync 
settings in iTunes. </P>

<P>Ringtones, music, audiobooks, podcasts, and video content are synced from your 
iTunes library. If you don&#8217;t already have content in iTunes, the iTunes Store (available in 
some countries) makes it easy to purchase or subscribe to content and download it to 
iTunes. You can also add music to your iTunes library from your CDs. To learn about 
iTunes and the iTunes Store, open iTunes and choose Help &gt; iTunes Help. </P>

your computer, as described below. Contacts and calendars are synced both ways 
between your computer and iPhone. New entries or changes you make on iPhone are 
synced to your computer, and vice versa. Webpage bookmarks are also synced both 
ways. </P>

iPhone. This allows you to customize your email accounts on iPhone without affecting 
email account settings on your computer. </P>

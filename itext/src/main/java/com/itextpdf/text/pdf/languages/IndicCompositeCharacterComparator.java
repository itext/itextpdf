/**

 * This works on CompositeCharcaters or Juktakshar-s of Indian languages like Bangla, Hindi, etc. CompositeCharcters
 * are single glyphs consisting of more than one characters.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * This class works on these CompositeCharacters and places the Strings having higher number
 * of Characters before the one with lower no. This is necessay to properly display the CompositeCharacters
 * when they occur side by side.

/**
 * A simple text extraction renderer.
 * 
 * This renderer keeps track of the current Y position of each string.  If it detects
 * that the y position has changed, it inserts a line break into the output.  If the
 * PDF renders text in a non-top-to-bottom fashion, this will result in the text not
 * being a true representation of how it appears in the PDF.
 * 
 * This renderer also uses a simple strategy based on the font metrics to determine if
 * a blank space should be inserted into the output.

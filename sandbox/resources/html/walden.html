  <h2>Economy</h2>

  <p>When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone, in the
  woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had built myself, on the shore of
  Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts, and earned my living by the labor of my hands
  only. I lived there two years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized
  life again.</p>

  <p>I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very
  particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which
  some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but,
  considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got
  to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been
  curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some,
  who have large families, how many poor children I maintained. I will therefore ask
  those of my readers who feel no particular interest in me to pardon me if I undertake
  to answer some of these questions in this book. In most books, the <i>I</i>, or first
  person, is omitted; in this it will be retained; that, in respect to egotism, is the
  main difference. We commonly do not remember that it is, after all, always the first
  person that is speaking. I should not talk so much about myself if there were anybody
  else whom I knew as well. Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness
  of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a
  simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other
  men's lives; some such account as he would send to his kindred from a distant land; for
  if he has lived sincerely, it must have been in a distant land to me. Perhaps these
  pages are more particularly addressed to poor students. As for the rest of my readers,
  they will accept such portions as apply to them. I trust that none will stretch the
  seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits.</p>

  <p>I would fain say something, not so much concerning the Chinese and Sandwich
  Islanders as you who read these pages, who are said to live in New England; something
  about your condition, especially your outward condition or circumstances in this world,
  in this town, what it is, whether it is necessary that it be as bad as it is, whether
  it cannot be improved as well as not. I have travelled a good deal in Concord; and
  everywhere, in shops, and offices, and fields, the inhabitants have appeared to me to
  be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways. What I have heard of Bramins sitting
  exposed to four fires and looking in the face of the sun; or hanging suspended, with
  their heads downward, over flames; or looking at the heavens over their shoulders
  "until it becomes impossible for them to resume their natural position, while from the
  twist of the neck nothing but liquids can pass into the stomach"; or dwelling, chained
  for life, at the foot of a tree; or measuring with their bodies, like caterpillars, the
  breadth of vast empires; or standing on one leg on the tops of pillars&#8212;even these
  forms of conscious penance are hardly more incredible and astonishing than the scenes
  which I daily witness. The twelve labors of Hercules were trifling in comparison with
  those which my neighbors have undertaken; for they were only twelve, and had an end;
  but I could never see that these men slew or captured any monster or finished any
  labor. They have no friend Iolaus to burn with a hot iron the root of the hydra's head,
  but as soon as one head is crushed, two spring up.</p>

  <p>I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms,
  houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more easily acquired than got
  rid of. Better if they had been born in the open pasture and suckled by a wolf, that
  they might have seen with clearer eyes what field they were called to labor in. Who
  made them serfs of the soil? Why should they eat their sixty acres, when man is
  condemned to eat only his peck of dirt? Why should they begin digging their graves as
  soon as they are born? They have got to live a man's life, pushing all these things
  before them, and get on as well as they can. How many a poor immortal soul have I met
  well-nigh crushed and smothered under its load, creeping down the road of life, pushing
  before it a barn seventy-five feet by forty, its Augean stables never cleansed, and one
  hundred acres of land, tillage, mowing, pasture, and woodlot! The portionless, who
  struggle with no such unnecessary inherited encumbrances, find it labor enough to
  subdue and cultivate a few cubic feet of flesh.</p>

  <p>But men labor under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon plowed into the
  soil for compost. By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity, they are employed, as
  it says in an old book, laying up treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and
  thieves break through and steal. It is a fool's life, as they will find when they get
  to the end of it, if not before. It is said that Deucalion and Pyrrha created men by
  throwing stones over their heads behind them:&#8212;</p>
  <pre>           Inde genus durum sumus, experiensque laborum,
           Et documenta damus qua simus origine nati.
</pre>

  <p class="nind">Or, as Raleigh rhymes it in his sonorous way,&#8212;</p>
  <pre>  "From thence our kind hard-hearted is, enduring pain and care,
   Approving that our bodies of a stony nature are."
</pre>

  <p class="nind">So much for a blind obedience to a blundering oracle, throwing the
  stones over their heads behind them, and not seeing where they fell.</p>

  <p>Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and
  mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of
  life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them. Their fingers, from excessive
  toil, are too clumsy and tremble too much for that. Actually, the laboring man has not
  leisure for a true integrity day by day; he cannot afford to sustain the manliest
  relations to men; his labor would be depreciated in the market. He has no time to be
  anything but a machine. How can he remember well his ignorance&#8212;which his growth
  requires&#8212;who has so often to use his knowledge? We should feed and clothe him
  gratuitously sometimes, and recruit him with our cordials, before we judge of him. The
  finest qualities of our nature, like the bloom on fruits, can be preserved only by the
  most delicate handling. Yet we do not treat ourselves nor one another thus
  tenderly.</p>

  <p>Some of you, we all know, are poor, find it hard to live, are sometimes, as it were,
  gasping for breath. I have no doubt that some of you who read this book are unable to
  pay for all the dinners which you have actually eaten, or for the coats and shoes which
  are fast wearing or are already worn out, and have come to this page to spend borrowed
  or stolen time, robbing your creditors of an hour. It is very evident what mean and
  sneaking lives many of you live, for my sight has been whetted by experience; always on
  the limits, trying to get into business and trying to get out of debt, a very ancient
  slough, called by the Latins <i>aes alienum</i>, another's brass, for some of their
  coins were made of brass; still living, and dying, and buried by this other's brass;
  always promising to pay, promising to pay, tomorrow, and dying today, insolvent;
  seeking to curry favor, to get custom, by how many modes, only not state-prison
  offenses; lying, flattering, voting, contracting yourselves into a nutshell of civility
  or dilating into an atmosphere of thin and vaporous generosity, that you may persuade
  your neighbor to let you make his shoes, or his hat, or his coat, or his carriage, or
  import his groceries for him; making yourselves sick, that you may lay up something
  against a sick day, something to be tucked away in an old chest, or in a stocking
  behind the plastering, or, more safely, in the brick bank; no matter where, no matter
  how much or how little.</p>

  <p>I sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous, I may almost say, as to attend to
  the gross but somewhat foreign form of servitude called Negro Slavery, there are so
  many keen and subtle masters that enslave both North and South. It is hard to have a
  Southern overseer; it is worse to have a Northern one; but worst of all when you are
  the slave-driver of yourself. Talk of a divinity in man! Look at the teamster on the
  highway, wending to market by day or night; does any divinity stir within him? His
  highest duty to fodder and water his horses! What is his destiny to him compared with
  the shipping interests? Does not he drive for Squire Make-a-stir? How godlike, how
  immortal, is he? See how he cowers and sneaks, how vaguely all the day he fears, not
  being immortal nor divine, but the slave and prisoner of his own opinion of himself, a
  fame won by his own deeds. Public opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own
  private opinion. What a man thinks of himself, that it is which determines, or rather
  indicates, his fate. Self-emancipation even in the West Indian provinces of the fancy
  and imagination&#8212;what Wilberforce is there to bring that about? Think, also, of
  the ladies of the land weaving toilet cushions against the last day, not to betray too
  green an interest in their fates! As if you could kill time without injuring
  eternity.</p>

  <p>The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is
  confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and
  have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but
  unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of
  mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is a
  characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.</p>

  <p>When we consider what, to use the words of the catechism, is the chief end of man,
  and what are the true necessaries and means of life, it appears as if men had
  deliberately chosen the common mode of living because they preferred it to any other.
  Yet they honestly think there is no choice left. But alert and healthy natures remember
  that the sun rose clear. It is never too late to give up our prejudices. No way of
  thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted without proof. What everybody echoes
  or in silence passes by as true to-day may turn out to be falsehood to-morrow, mere
  smoke of opinion, which some had trusted for a cloud that would sprinkle fertilizing
  rain on their fields. What old people say you cannot do, you try and find that you can.
  Old deeds for old people, and new deeds for new. Old people did not know enough once,
  perchance, to fetch fresh fuel to keep the fire a-going; new people put a little dry
  wood under a pot, and are whirled round the globe with the speed of birds, in a way to
  kill old people, as the phrase is. Age is no better, hardly so well, qualified for an
  instructor as youth, for it has not profited so much as it has lost. One may almost
  doubt if the wisest man has learned anything of absolute value by living. Practically,
  the old have no very important advice to give the young, their own experience has been
  so partial, and their lives have been such miserable failures, for private reasons, as
  they must believe; and it may be that they have some faith left which belies that
  experience, and they are only less young than they were. I have lived some thirty years
  on this planet, and I have yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest
  advice from my seniors. They have told me nothing, and probably cannot tell me anything
  to the purpose. Here is life, an experiment to a great extent untried by me; but it
  does not avail me that they have tried it. If I have any experience which I think
  valuable, I am sure to reflect that this my Mentors said nothing about.</p>

  <p>One farmer says to me, "You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for it furnishes
  nothing to make bones with"; and so he religiously devotes a part of his day to
  supplying his system with the raw material of bones; walking all the while he talks
  behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made bones, jerk him and his lumbering plow
  along in spite of every obstacle. Some things are really necessaries of life in some
  circles, the most helpless and diseased, which in others are luxuries merely, and in
  others still are entirely unknown.</p>

  <p>The whole ground of human life seems to some to have been gone over by their
  predecessors, both the heights and the valleys, and all things to have been cared for.
  According to Evelyn, "the wise Solomon prescribed ordinances for the very distances of
  trees; and the Roman pr&#230;tors have decided how often you may go into your
  neighbor's land to gather the acorns which fall on it without trespass, and what share
  belongs to that neighbor." Hippocrates has even left directions how we should cut our
  nails; that is, even with the ends of the fingers, neither shorter nor longer.
  Undoubtedly the very tedium and ennui which presume to have exhausted the variety and
  the joys of life are as old as Adam. But man's capacities have never been measured; nor
  are we to judge of what he can do by any precedents, so little has been tried. Whatever
  have been thy failures hitherto, "be not afflicted, my child, for who shall assign to
  thee what thou hast left undone?"</p>

  <p>We might try our lives by a thousand simple tests; as, for instance, that the same
  sun which ripens my beans illumines at once a system of earths like ours. If I had
  remembered this it would have prevented some mistakes. This was not the light in which
  I hoed them. The stars are the apexes of what wonderful triangles! What distant and
  different beings in the various mansions of the universe are contemplating the same one
  at the same moment! Nature and human life are as various as our several constitutions.
  Who shall say what prospect life offers to another? Could a greater miracle take place
  than for us to look through each other's eyes for an instant? We should live in all the
  ages of the world in an hour; ay, in all the worlds of the ages. History, Poetry,
  Mythology!&#8212;I know of no reading of another's experience so startling and
  informing as this would be.</p>

  <p>The greater part of what my neighbors call good I believe in my soul to be bad, and
  if I repent of anything, it is very likely to be my good behavior. What demon possessed
  me that I behaved so well? You may say the wisest thing you can, old man&#8212;you who
  have lived seventy years, not without honor of a kind&#8212;I hear an irresistible
  voice which invites me away from all that. One generation abandons the enterprises of
  another like stranded vessels.</p>

  <p>I think that we may safely trust a good deal more than we do. We may waive just so
  much care of ourselves as we honestly bestow elsewhere. Nature is as well adapted to
  our weakness as to our strength. The incessant anxiety and strain of some is a
  well-nigh incurable form of disease. We are made to exaggerate the importance of what
  work we do; and yet how much is not done by us! or, what if we had been taken sick? How
  vigilant we are! determined not to live by faith if we can avoid it; all the day long
  on the alert, at night we unwillingly say our prayers and commit ourselves to
  uncertainties. So thoroughly and sincerely are we compelled to live, reverencing our
  life, and denying the possibility of change. This is the only way, we say; but there
  are as many ways as there can be drawn radii from one centre. All change is a miracle
  to contemplate; but it is a miracle which is taking place every instant. Confucius
  said, "To know that we know what we know, and that we do not know what we do not know,
  that is true knowledge." When one man has reduced a fact of the imagination to be a
  fact to his understanding, I foresee that all men at length establish their lives on
  that basis.</p>

  <p>Let us consider for a moment what most of the trouble and anxiety which I have
  referred to is about, and how much it is necessary that we be troubled, or at least
  careful. It would be some advantage to live a primitive and frontier life, though in
  the midst of an outward civilization, if only to learn what are the gross necessaries
  of life and what methods have been taken to obtain them; or even to look over the old
  day-books of the merchants, to see what it was that men most commonly bought at the
  stores, what they stored, that is, what are the grossest groceries. For the
  improvements of ages have had but little influence on the essential laws of man's
  existence; as our skeletons, probably, are not to be distinguished from those of our
  ancestors.</p>

  <p>By the words, <i>necessary of life</i>, I mean whatever, of all that man obtains by
  his own exertions, has been from the first, or from long use has become, so important
  to human life that few, if any, whether from savageness, or poverty, or philosophy,
  ever attempt to do without it. To many creatures there is in this sense but one
  necessary of life, Food. To the bison of the prairie it is a few inches of palatable
  grass, with water to drink; unless he seeks the Shelter of the forest or the mountain's
  shadow. None of the brute creation requires more than Food and Shelter. The necessaries
  of life for man in this climate may, accurately enough, be distributed under the
  several heads of Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel; for not till we have secured these
  are we prepared to entertain the true problems of life with freedom and a prospect of
  success. Man has invented, not only houses, but clothes and cooked food; and possibly
  from the accidental discovery of the warmth of fire, and the consequent use of it, at
  first a luxury, arose the present necessity to sit by it. We observe cats and dogs
  acquiring the same second nature. By proper Shelter and Clothing we legitimately retain
  our own internal heat; but with an excess of these, or of Fuel, that is, with an
  external heat greater than our own internal, may not cookery properly be said to begin?
  Darwin, the naturalist, says of the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, that while his own
  party, who were well clothed and sitting close to a fire, were far from too warm, these
  naked savages, who were farther off, were observed, to his great surprise, "to be
  streaming with perspiration at undergoing such a roasting." So, we are told, the New
  Hollander goes naked with impunity, while the European shivers in his clothes. Is it
  impossible to combine the hardiness of these savages with the intellectualness of the
  civilized man? According to Liebig, man's body is a stove, and food the fuel which
  keeps up the internal combustion in the lungs. In cold weather we eat more, in warm
  less. The animal heat is the result of a slow combustion, and disease and death take
  place when this is too rapid; or for want of fuel, or from some defect in the draught,
  the fire goes out. Of course the vital heat is not to be confounded with fire; but so
  much for analogy. It appears, therefore, from the above list, that the expression,
  <i>animal life</i>, is nearly synonymous with the expression, <i>animal heat</i>; for
  while Food may be regarded as the Fuel which keeps up the fire within us&#8212;and Fuel
  serves only to prepare that Food or to increase the warmth of our bodies by addition
  from without&#8212;Shelter and Clothing also serve only to retain the heat thus
  generated and absorbed.</p>

  <p>The grand necessity, then, for our bodies, is to keep warm, to keep the vital heat
  in us. What pains we accordingly take, not only with our Food, and Clothing, and
  Shelter, but with our beds, which are our night-clothes, robbing the nests and breasts
  of birds to prepare this shelter within a shelter, as the mole has its bed of grass and
  leaves at the end of its burrow! The poor man is wont to complain that this is a cold
  world; and to cold, no less physical than social, we refer directly a great part of our
  ails. The summer, in some climates, makes possible to man a sort of Elysian life. Fuel,
  except to cook his Food, is then unnecessary; the sun is his fire, and many of the
  fruits are sufficiently cooked by its rays; while Food generally is more various, and
  more easily obtained, and Clothing and Shelter are wholly or half unnecessary. At the
  present day, and in this country, as I find by my own experience, a few implements, a
  knife, an axe, a spade, a wheelbarrow, etc., and for the studious, lamplight,
  stationery, and access to a few books, rank next to necessaries, and can all be
  obtained at a trifling cost. Yet some, not wise, go to the other side of the globe, to
  barbarous and unhealthy regions, and devote themselves to trade for ten or twenty
  years, in order that they may live&#8212;that is, keep comfortably warm&#8212;and die
  in New England at last. The luxuriously rich are not simply kept comfortably warm, but
  unnaturally hot; as I implied before, they are cooked, of course <i>&#224; la
  mode</i>.</p>

  <p>Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not
  indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind. With respect to
  luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meagre life than
  the poor. The ancient philosophers, Chinese, Hindoo, Persian, and Greek, were a class
  than which none has been poorer in outward riches, none so rich in inward. We know not
  much about them. It is remarkable that we know so much of them as we do. The same is
  true of the more modern reformers and benefactors of their race. None can be an
  impartial or wise observer of human life but from the vantage ground of what we should
  call voluntary poverty. Of a life of luxury the fruit is luxury, whether in
  agriculture, or commerce, or literature, or art. There are nowadays professors of
  philosophy, but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once
  admirable to live. To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even
  to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life
  of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the
  problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically. The success of great
  scholars and thinkers is commonly a courtier-like success, not kingly, not manly. They
  make shift to live merely by conformity, practically as their fathers did, and are in
  no sense the progenitors of a noble race of men. But why do men degenerate ever? What
  makes families run out? What is the nature of the luxury which enervates and destroys
  nations? Are we sure that there is none of it in our own lives? The philosopher is in
  advance of his age even in the outward form of his life. He is not fed, sheltered,
  clothed, warmed, like his contemporaries. How can a man be a philosopher and not
  maintain his vital heat by better methods than other men?</p>

  <p>When a man is warmed by the several modes which I have described, what does he want
  next? Surely not more warmth of the same kind, as more and richer food, larger and more
  splendid houses, finer and more abundant clothing, more numerous, incessant, and hotter
  fires, and the like. When he has obtained those things which are necessary to life,
  there is another alternative than to obtain the superfluities; and that is, to
  adventure on life now, his vacation from humbler toil having commenced. The soil, it
  appears, is suited to the seed, for it has sent its radicle downward, and it may now
  send its shoot upward also with confidence. Why has man rooted himself thus firmly in
  the earth, but that he may rise in the same proportion into the heavens
  above?&#8212;for the nobler plants are valued for the fruit they bear at last in the
  air and light, far from the ground, and are not treated like the humbler esculents,
  which, though they may be biennials, are cultivated only till they have perfected their
  root, and often cut down at top for this purpose, so that most would not know them in
  their flowering season.</p>

  <p>I do not mean to prescribe rules to strong and valiant natures, who will mind their
  own affairs whether in heaven or hell, and perchance build more magnificently and spend
  more lavishly than the richest, without ever impoverishing themselves, not knowing how
  they live&#8212;if, indeed, there are any such, as has been dreamed; nor to those who
  find their encouragement and inspiration in precisely the present condition of things,
  and cherish it with the fondness and enthusiasm of lovers&#8212;and, to some extent, I
  reckon myself in this number; I do not speak to those who are well employed, in
  whatever circumstances, and they know whether they are well employed or not;&#8212;but
  mainly to the mass of men who are discontented, and idly complaining of the hardness of
  their lot or of the times, when they might improve them. There are some who complain
  most energetically and inconsolably of any, because they are, as they say, doing their
  duty. I also have in my mind that seemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished
  class of all, who have accumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or get rid of it,
  and thus have forged their own golden or silver fetters.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>If I should attempt to tell how I have desired to spend my life in years past, it
  would probably surprise those of my readers who are somewhat acquainted with its actual
  history; it would certainly astonish those who know nothing about it. I will only hint
  at some of the enterprises which I have cherished.</p>

  <p>In any weather, at any hour of the day or night, I have been anxious to improve the
  nick of time, and notch it on my stick too; to stand on the meeting of two eternities,
  the past and future, which is precisely the present moment; to toe that line. You will
  pardon some obscurities, for there are more secrets in my trade than in most men's, and
  yet not voluntarily kept, but inseparable from its very nature. I would gladly tell all
  that I know about it, and never paint "No Admittance" on my gate.</p>

  <p>I long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle dove, and am still on their
  trail. Many are the travellers I have spoken concerning them, describing their tracks
  and what calls they answered to. I have met one or two who had heard the hound, and the
  tramp of the horse, and even seen the dove disappear behind a cloud, and they seemed as
  anxious to recover them as if they had lost them themselves.</p>

  <p>To anticipate, not the sunrise and the dawn merely, but, if possible, Nature
  herself! How many mornings, summer and winter, before yet any neighbor was stirring
  about his business, have I been about mine! No doubt, many of my townsmen have met me
  returning from this enterprise, farmers starting for Boston in the twilight, or
  woodchoppers going to their work. It is true, I never assisted the sun materially in
  his rising, but, doubt not, it was of the last importance only to be present at it.</p>

  <p>So many autumn, ay, and winter days, spent outside the town, trying to hear what was
  in the wind, to hear and carry it express! I well-nigh sunk all my capital in it, and
  lost my own breath into the bargain, running in the face of it. If it had concerned
  either of the political parties, depend upon it, it would have appeared in the Gazette
  with the earliest intelligence. At other times watching from the observatory of some
  cliff or tree, to telegraph any new arrival; or waiting at evening on the hill-tops for
  the sky to fall, that I might catch something, though I never caught much, and that,
  manna-wise, would dissolve again in the sun.</p>

  <p>For a long time I was reporter to a journal, of no very wide circulation, whose
  editor has never yet seen fit to print the bulk of my contributions, and, as is too
  common with writers, I got only my labor for my pains. However, in this case my pains
  were their own reward.</p>

  <p>For many years I was self-appointed inspector of snow-storms and rain-storms, and
  did my duty faithfully; surveyor, if not of highways, then of forest paths and all
  across-lot routes, keeping them open, and ravines bridged and passable at all seasons,
  where the public heel had testified to their utility.</p>

  <p>I have looked after the wild stock of the town, which give a faithful herdsman a
  good deal of trouble by leaping fences; and I have had an eye to the unfrequented nooks
  and corners of the farm; though I did not always know whether Jonas or Solomon worked
  in a particular field to-day; that was none of my business. I have watered the red
  huckleberry, the sand cherry and the nettle-tree, the red pine and the black ash, the
  white grape and the yellow violet, which might have withered else in dry seasons.</p>

  <p>In short, I went on thus for a long time (I may say it without boasting), faithfully
  minding my business, till it became more and more evident that my townsmen would not
  after all admit me into the list of town officers, nor make my place a sinecure with a
  moderate allowance. My accounts, which I can swear to have kept faithfully, I have,
  indeed, never got audited, still less accepted, still less paid and settled. However, I
  have not set my heart on that.</p>

  <p>Not long since, a strolling Indian went to sell baskets at the house of a well-known
  lawyer in my neighborhood. "Do you wish to buy any baskets?" he asked. "No, we do not
  want any," was the reply. "What!" exclaimed the Indian as he went out the gate, "do you
  mean to starve us?" Having seen his industrious white neighbors so well off&#8212;that
  the lawyer had only to weave arguments, and, by some magic, wealth and standing
  followed&#8212;he had said to himself: I will go into business; I will weave baskets;
  it is a thing which I can do. Thinking that when he had made the baskets he would have
  done his part, and then it would be the white man's to buy them. He had not discovered
  that it was necessary for him to make it worth the other's while to buy them, or at
  least make him think that it was so, or to make something else which it would be worth
  his while to buy. I too had woven a kind of basket of a delicate texture, but I had not
  made it worth any one's while to buy them. Yet not the less, in my case, did I think it
  worth my while to weave them, and instead of studying how to make it worth men's while
  to buy my baskets, I studied rather how to avoid the necessity of selling them. The
  life which men praise and regard as successful is but one kind. Why should we
  exaggerate any one kind at the expense of the others?</p>

  <p>Finding that my fellow-citizens were not likely to offer me any room in the court
  house, or any curacy or living anywhere else, but I must shift for myself, I turned my
  face more exclusively than ever to the woods, where I was better known. I determined to
  go into business at once, and not wait to acquire the usual capital, using such slender
  means as I had already got. My purpose in going to Walden Pond was not to live cheaply
  nor to live dearly there, but to transact some private business with the fewest
  obstacles; to be hindered from accomplishing which for want of a little common sense, a
  little enterprise and business talent, appeared not so sad as foolish.</p>

  <p>I have always endeavored to acquire strict business habits; they are indispensable
  to every man. If your trade is with the Celestial Empire, then some small counting
  house on the coast, in some Salem harbor, will be fixture enough. You will export such
  articles as the country affords, purely native products, much ice and pine timber and a
  little granite, always in native bottoms. These will be good ventures. To oversee all
  the details yourself in person; to be at once pilot and captain, and owner and
  underwriter; to buy and sell and keep the accounts; to read every letter received, and
  write or read every letter sent; to superintend the discharge of imports night and day;
  to be upon many parts of the coast almost at the same time&#8212;often the richest
  freight will be discharged upon a Jersey shore;&#8212;to be your own telegraph,
  unweariedly sweeping the horizon, speaking all passing vessels bound coastwise; to keep
  up a steady despatch of commodities, for the supply of such a distant and exorbitant
  market; to keep yourself informed of the state of the markets, prospects of war and
  peace everywhere, and anticipate the tendencies of trade and civilization&#8212;taking
  advantage of the results of all exploring expeditions, using new passages and all
  improvements in navigation;&#8212;charts to be studied, the position of reefs and new
  lights and buoys to be ascertained, and ever, and ever, the logarithmic tables to be
  corrected, for by the error of some calculator the vessel often splits upon a rock that
  should have reached a friendly pier&#8212;there is the untold fate of La
  Prouse;&#8212;universal science to be kept pace with, studying the lives of all great
  discoverers and navigators, great adventurers and merchants, from Hanno and the
  Phoenicians down to our day; in fine, account of stock to be taken from time to time,
  to know how you stand. It is a labor to task the faculties of a man&#8212;such problems
  of profit and loss, of interest, of tare and tret, and gauging of all kinds in it, as
  demand a universal knowledge.</p>

  <p>I have thought that Walden Pond would be a good place for business, not solely on
  account of the railroad and the ice trade; it offers advantages which it may not be
  good policy to divulge; it is a good port and a good foundation. No Neva marshes to be
  filled; though you must everywhere build on piles of your own driving. It is said that
  a flood-tide, with a westerly wind, and ice in the Neva, would sweep St. Petersburg
  from the face of the earth.</p>

  <p>As this business was to be entered into without the usual capital, it may not be
  easy to conjecture where those means, that will still be indispensable to every such
  undertaking, were to be obtained. As for Clothing, to come at once to the practical
  part of the question, perhaps we are led oftener by the love of novelty and a regard
  for the opinions of men, in procuring it, than by a true utility. Let him who has work
  to do recollect that the object of clothing is, first, to retain the vital heat, and
  secondly, in this state of society, to cover nakedness, and he may judge how much of
  any necessary or important work may be accomplished without adding to his wardrobe.
  Kings and queens who wear a suit but once, though made by some tailor or dressmaker to
  their majesties, cannot know the comfort of wearing a suit that fits. They are no
  better than wooden horses to hang the clean clothes on. Every day our garments become
  more assimilated to ourselves, receiving the impress of the wearer's character, until
  we hesitate to lay them aside without such delay and medical appliances and some such
  solemnity even as our bodies. No man ever stood the lower in my estimation for having a
  patch in his clothes; yet I am sure that there is greater anxiety, commonly, to have
  fashionable, or at least clean and unpatched clothes, than to have a sound conscience.
  But even if the rent is not mended, perhaps the worst vice betrayed is improvidence. I
  sometimes try my acquaintances by such tests as this&#8212;Who could wear a patch, or
  two extra seams only, over the knee? Most behave as if they believed that their
  prospects for life would be ruined if they should do it. It would be easier for them to
  hobble to town with a broken leg than with a broken pantaloon. Often if an accident
  happens to a gentleman's legs, they can be mended; but if a similar accident happens to
  the legs of his pantaloons, there is no help for it; for he considers, not what is
  truly respectable, but what is respected. We know but few men, a great many coats and
  breeches. Dress a scarecrow in your last shift, you standing shiftless by, who would
  not soonest salute the scarecrow? Passing a cornfield the other day, close by a hat and
  coat on a stake, I recognized the owner of the farm. He was only a little more
  weather-beaten than when I saw him last. I have heard of a dog that barked at every
  stranger who approached his master's premises with clothes on, but was easily quieted
  by a naked thief. It is an interesting question how far men would retain their relative
  rank if they were divested of their clothes. Could you, in such a case, tell surely of
  any company of civilized men which belonged to the most respected class? When Madam
  Pfeiffer, in her adventurous travels round the world, from east to west, had got so
  near home as Asiatic Russia, she says that she felt the necessity of wearing other than
  a travelling dress, when she went to meet the authorities, for she "was now in a
  civilized country, where... people are judged of by their clothes." Even in our
  democratic New England towns the accidental possession of wealth, and its manifestation
  in dress and equipage alone, obtain for the possessor almost universal respect. But
  they yield such respect, numerous as they are, are so far heathen, and need to have a
  missionary sent to them. Beside, clothes introduced sewing, a kind of work which you
  may call endless; a woman's dress, at least, is never done.</p>

  <p>A man who has at length found something to do will not need to get a new suit to do
  it in; for him the old will do, that has lain dusty in the garret for an indeterminate
  period. Old shoes will serve a hero longer than they have served his valet&#8212;if a
  hero ever has a valet&#8212;bare feet are older than shoes, and he can make them do.
  Only they who go to soir&#233;es and legislative balls must have new coats, coats to
  change as often as the man changes in them. But if my jacket and trousers, my hat and
  shoes, are fit to worship God in, they will do; will they not? Who ever saw his old
  clothes&#8212;his old coat, actually worn out, resolved into its primitive elements, so
  that it was not a deed of charity to bestow it on some poor boy, by him perchance to be
  bestowed on some poorer still, or shall we say richer, who could do with less? I say,
  beware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather a new wearer of
  clothes. If there is not a new man, how can the new clothes be made to fit? If you have
  any enterprise before you, try it in your old clothes. All men want, not something to
  <i>do with</i>, but something to <i>do</i>, or rather something to <i>be</i>. Perhaps
  we should never procure a new suit, however ragged or dirty the old, until we have so
  conducted, so enterprised or sailed in some way, that we feel like new men in the old,
  and that to retain it would be like keeping new wine in old bottles. Our moulting
  season, like that of the fowls, must be a crisis in our lives. The loon retires to
  solitary ponds to spend it. Thus also the snake casts its slough, and the caterpillar
  its wormy coat, by an internal industry and expansion; for clothes are but our outmost
  cuticle and mortal coil. Otherwise we shall be found sailing under false colors, and be
  inevitably cashiered at last by our own opinion, as well as that of mankind.</p>

  <p>We don garment after garment, as if we grew like exogenous plants by addition
  without. Our outside and often thin and fanciful clothes are our epidermis, or false
  skin, which partakes not of our life, and may be stripped off here and there without
  fatal injury; our thicker garments, constantly worn, are our cellular integument, or
  cortex; but our shirts are our liber, or true bark, which cannot be removed without
  girdling and so destroying the man. I believe that all races at some seasons wear
  something equivalent to the shirt. It is desirable that a man be clad so simply that he
  can lay his hands on himself in the dark, and that he live in all respects so compactly
  and preparedly that, if an enemy take the town, he can, like the old philosopher, walk
  out the gate empty-handed without anxiety. While one thick garment is, for most
  purposes, as good as three thin ones, and cheap clothing can be obtained at prices
  really to suit customers; while a thick coat can be bought for five dollars, which will
  last as many years, thick pantaloons for two dollars, cowhide boots for a dollar and a
  half a pair, a summer hat for a quarter of a dollar, and a winter cap for sixty-two and
  a half cents, or a better be made at home at a nominal cost, where is he so poor that,
  clad in such a suit, of <i>his own earning</i>, there will not be found wise men to do
  him reverence?</p>

  <p>When I ask for a garment of a particular form, my tailoress tells me gravely, "They
  do not make them so now," not emphasizing the "They" at all, as if she quoted an
  authority as impersonal as the Fates, and I find it difficult to get made what I want,
  simply because she cannot believe that I mean what I say, that I am so rash. When I
  hear this oracular sentence, I am for a moment absorbed in thought, emphasizing to
  myself each word separately that I may come at the meaning of it, that I may find out
  by what degree of consanguinity <i>They</i> are related to <i>me</i>, and what
  authority they may have in an affair which affects me so nearly; and, finally, I am
  inclined to answer her with equal mystery, and without any more emphasis of the
  "they"&#8212;"It is true, they did not make them so recently, but they do now." Of what
  use this measuring of me if she does not measure my character, but only the breadth of
  my shoulders, as it were a peg to bang the coat on? We worship not the Graces, nor the
  Parcae, but Fashion. She spins and weaves and cuts with full authority. The head monkey
  at Paris puts on a traveller's cap, and all the monkeys in America do the same. I
  sometimes despair of getting anything quite simple and honest done in this world by the
  help of men. They would have to be passed through a powerful press first, to squeeze
  their old notions out of them, so that they would not soon get upon their legs again;
  and then there would be some one in the company with a maggot in his head, hatched from
  an egg deposited there nobody knows when, for not even fire kills these things, and you
  would have lost your labor. Nevertheless, we will not forget that some Egyptian wheat
  was handed down to us by a mummy.</p>

  <p>On the whole, I think that it cannot be maintained that dressing has in this or any
  country risen to the dignity of an art. At present men make shift to wear what they can
  get. Like shipwrecked sailors, they put on what they can find on the beach, and at a
  little distance, whether of space or time, laugh at each other's masquerade. Every
  generation laughs at the old fashions, but follows religiously the new. We are amused
  at beholding the costume of Henry VIII, or Queen Elizabeth, as much as if it was that
  of the King and Queen of the Cannibal Islands. All costume off a man is pitiful or
  grotesque. It is only the serious eye peering from and the sincere life passed within
  it which restrain laughter and consecrate the costume of any people. Let Harlequin be
  taken with a fit of the colic and his trappings will have to serve that mood too. When
  the soldier is hit by a cannonball, rags are as becoming as purple.</p>

  <p>The childish and savage taste of men and women for new patterns keeps how many
  shaking and squinting through kaleidoscopes that they may discover the particular
  figure which this generation requires today. The manufacturers have learned that this
  taste is merely whimsical. Of two patterns which differ only by a few threads more or
  less of a particular color, the one will be sold readily, the other lie on the shelf,
  though it frequently happens that after the lapse of a season the latter becomes the
  most fashionable. Comparatively, tattooing is not the hideous custom which it is
  called. It is not barbarous merely because the printing is skin-deep and
  unalterable.</p>

  <p>I cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get
  clothing. The condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the
  English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as far as I have heard or observed, the
  principal object is, not that mankind may be well and honestly clad, but,
  unquestionably, that corporations may be enriched. In the long run men hit only what
  they aim at. Therefore, though they should fail immediately, they had better aim at
  something high.</p>

  <p>As for a Shelter, I will not deny that this is now a necessary of life, though there
  are instances of men having done without it for long periods in colder countries than
  this. Samuel Laing says that "the Laplander in his skin dress, and in a skin bag which
  he puts over his head and shoulders, will sleep night after night on the snow... in a
  degree of cold which would extinguish the life of one exposed to it in any woollen
  clothing." He had seen them asleep thus. Yet he adds, "They are not hardier than other
  people." But, probably, man did not live long on the earth without discovering the
  convenience which there is in a house, the domestic comforts, which phrase may have
  originally signified the satisfactions of the house more than of the family; though
  these must be extremely partial and occasional in those climates where the house is
  associated in our thoughts with winter or the rainy season chiefly, and two thirds of
  the year, except for a parasol, is unnecessary. In our climate, in the summer, it was
  formerly almost solely a covering at night. In the Indian gazettes a wigwam was the
  symbol of a day's march, and a row of them cut or painted on the bark of a tree
  signified that so many times they had camped. Man was not made so large limbed and
  robust but that he must seek to narrow his world and wall in a space such as fitted
  him. He was at first bare and out of doors; but though this was pleasant enough in
  serene and warm weather, by daylight, the rainy season and the winter, to say nothing
  of the torrid sun, would perhaps have nipped his race in the bud if he had not made
  haste to clothe himself with the shelter of a house. Adam and Eve, according to the
  fable, wore the bower before other clothes. Man wanted a home, a place of warmth, or
  comfort, first of warmth, then the warmth of the affections.</p>

  <p>We may imagine a time when, in the infancy of the human race, some enterprising
  mortal crept into a hollow in a rock for shelter. Every child begins the world again,
  to some extent, and loves to stay outdoors, even in wet and cold. It plays house, as
  well as horse, having an instinct for it. Who does not remember the interest with
  which, when young, he looked at shelving rocks, or any approach to a cave? It was the
  natural yearning of that portion, any portion of our most primitive ancestor which
  still survived in us. From the cave we have advanced to roofs of palm leaves, of bark
  and boughs, of linen woven and stretched, of grass and straw, of boards and shingles,
  of stones and tiles. At last, we know not what it is to live in the open air, and our
  lives are domestic in more senses than we think. From the hearth the field is a great
  distance. It would be well, perhaps, if we were to spend more of our days and nights
  without any obstruction between us and the celestial bodies, if the poet did not speak
  so much from under a roof, or the saint dwell there so long. Birds do not sing in
  caves, nor do doves cherish their innocence in dovecots.</p>

  <p>However, if one designs to construct a dwelling-house, it behooves him to exercise a
  little Yankee shrewdness, lest after all he find himself in a workhouse, a labyrinth
  without a clue, a museum, an almshouse, a prison, or a splendid mausoleum instead.
  Consider first how slight a shelter is absolutely necessary. I have seen Penobscot
  Indians, in this town, living in tents of thin cotton cloth, while the snow was nearly
  a foot deep around them, and I thought that they would be glad to have it deeper to
  keep out the wind. Formerly, when how to get my living honestly, with freedom left for
  my proper pursuits, was a question which vexed me even more than it does now, for
  unfortunately I am become somewhat callous, I used to see a large box by the railroad,
  six feet long by three wide, in which the laborers locked up their tools at night; and
  it suggested to me that every man who was hard pushed might get such a one for a
  dollar, and, having bored a few auger holes in it, to admit the air at least, get into
  it when it rained and at night, and hook down the lid, and so have freedom in his love,
  and in his soul be free. This did not appear the worst, nor by any means a despicable
  alternative. You could sit up as late as you pleased, and, whenever you got up, go
  abroad without any landlord or house-lord dogging you for rent. Many a man is harassed
  to death to pay the rent of a larger and more luxurious box who would not have frozen
  to death in such a box as this. I am far from jesting. Economy is a subject which
  admits of being treated with levity, but it cannot so be disposed of. A comfortable
  house for a rude and hardy race, that lived mostly out of doors, was once made here
  almost entirely of such materials as Nature furnished ready to their hands. Gookin, who
  was superintendent of the Indians subject to the Massachusetts Colony, writing in 1674,
  says, "The best of their houses are covered very neatly, tight and warm, with barks of
  trees, slipped from their bodies at those seasons when the sap is up, and made into
  great flakes, with pressure of weighty timber, when they are green.... The meaner sort
  are covered with mats which they make of a kind of bulrush, and are also indifferently
  tight and warm, but not so good as the former.... Some I have seen, sixty or a hundred
  feet long and thirty feet broad.... I have often lodged in their wigwams, and found
  them as warm as the best English houses." He adds that they were commonly carpeted and
  lined within with well-wrought embroidered mats, and were furnished with various
  utensils. The Indians had advanced so far as to regulate the effect of the wind by a
  mat suspended over the hole in the roof and moved by a string. Such a lodge was in the
  first instance constructed in a day or two at most, and taken down and put up in a few
  hours; and every family owned one, or its apartment in one.</p>

  <p>In the savage state every family owns a shelter as good as the best, and sufficient
  for its coarser and simpler wants; but I think that I speak within bounds when I say
  that, though the birds of the air have their nests, and the foxes their holes, and the
  savages their wigwams, in modern civilized society not more than one half the families
  own a shelter. In the large towns and cities, where civilization especially prevails,
  the number of those who own a shelter is a very small fraction of the whole. The rest
  pay an annual tax for this outside garment of all, become indispensable summer and
  winter, which would buy a village of Indian wigwams, but now helps to keep them poor as
  long as they live. I do not mean to insist here on the disadvantage of hiring compared
  with owning, but it is evident that the savage owns his shelter because it costs so
  little, while the civilized man hires his commonly because he cannot afford to own it;
  nor can he, in the long run, any better afford to hire. But, answers one, by merely
  paying this tax, the poor civilized man secures an abode which is a palace compared
  with the savage's. An annual rent of from twenty-five to a hundred dollars (these are
  the country rates) entitles him to the benefit of the improvements of centuries,
  spacious apartments, clean paint and paper, Rumford fire-place, back plastering,
  Venetian blinds, copper pump, spring lock, a commodious cellar, and many other things.
  But how happens it that he who is said to enjoy these things is so commonly a poor
  civilized man, while the savage, who has them not, is rich as a savage? If it is
  asserted that civilization is a real advance in the condition of man&#8212;and I think
  that it is, though only the wise improve their advantages&#8212;it must be shown that
  it has produced better dwellings without making them more costly; and the cost of a
  thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it,
  immediately or in the long run. An average house in this neighborhood costs perhaps
  eight hundred dollars, and to lay up this sum will take from ten to fifteen years of
  the laborer's life, even if he is not encumbered with a family&#8212;estimating the
  pecuniary value of every man's labor at one dollar a day, for if some receive more,
  others receive less;&#8212;so that he must have spent more than half his life commonly
  before his wigwam will be earned. If we suppose him to pay a rent instead, this is but
  a doubtful choice of evils. Would the savage have been wise to exchange his wigwam for
  a palace on these terms?</p>

  <p>It may be guessed that I reduce almost the whole advantage of holding this
  superfluous property as a fund in store against the future, so far as the individual is
  concerned, mainly to the defraying of funeral expenses. But perhaps a man is not
  required to bury himself. Nevertheless this points to an important distinction between
  the civilized man and the savage; and, no doubt, they have designs on us for our
  benefit, in making the life of a civilized people an <i>institution</i>, in which the
  life of the individual is to a great extent absorbed, in order to preserve and perfect
  that of the race. But I wish to show at what a sacrifice this advantage is at present
  obtained, and to suggest that we may possibly so live as to secure all the advantage
  without suffering any of the disadvantage. What mean ye by saying that the poor ye have
  always with you, or that the fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth
  are set on edge?</p>

  <p>"As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this
  proverb in Israel.</p>

  <p>"Behold all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son
  is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die."</p>

  <p>When I consider my neighbors, the farmers of Concord, who are at least as well off
  as the other classes, I find that for the most part they have been toiling twenty,
  thirty, or forty years, that they may become the real owners of their farms, which
  commonly they have inherited with encumbrances, or else bought with hired
  money&#8212;and we may regard one third of that toil as the cost of their
  houses&#8212;but commonly they have not paid for them yet. It is true, the encumbrances
  sometimes outweigh the value of the farm, so that the farm itself becomes one great
  encumbrance, and still a man is found to inherit it, being well acquainted with it, as
  he says. On applying to the assessors, I am surprised to learn that they cannot at once
  name a dozen in the town who own their farms free and clear. If you would know the
  history of these homesteads, inquire at the bank where they are mortgaged. The man who
  has actually paid for his farm with labor on it is so rare that every neighbor can
  point to him. I doubt if there are three such men in Concord. What has been said of the
  merchants, that a very large majority, even ninety-seven in a hundred, are sure to
  fail, is equally true of the farmers. With regard to the merchants, however, one of
  them says pertinently that a great part of their failures are not genuine pecuniary
  failures, but merely failures to fulfil their engagements, because it is inconvenient;
  that is, it is the moral character that breaks down. But this puts an infinitely worse
  face on the matter, and suggests, beside, that probably not even the other three
  succeed in saving their souls, but are perchance bankrupt in a worse sense than they
  who fail honestly. Bankruptcy and repudiation are the springboards from which much of
  our civilization vaults and turns its somersets, but the savage stands on the unelastic
  plank of famine. Yet the Middlesex Cattle Show goes off here with <i>&#233;clat</i>
  annually, as if all the joints of the agricultural machine were suent.</p>

  <p>The farmer is endeavoring to solve the problem of a livelihood by a formula more
  complicated than the problem itself. To get his shoestrings he speculates in herds of
  cattle. With consummate skill he has set his trap with a hair spring to catch comfort
  and independence, and then, as he turned away, got his own leg into it. This is the
  reason he is poor; and for a similar reason we are all poor in respect to a thousand
  savage comforts, though surrounded by luxuries. As Chapman sings,</p>
  <pre>             "The false society of men&#8212;
                &#8212;for earthly greatness
              All heavenly comforts rarefies to air."
</pre>

  <p class="nind">And when the farmer has got his house, he may not be the richer but the
  poorer for it, and it be the house that has got him. As I understand it, that was a
  valid objection urged by Momus against the house which Minerva made, that she "had not
  made it movable, by which means a bad neighborhood might be avoided"; and it may still
  be urged, for our houses are such unwieldy property that we are often imprisoned rather
  than housed in them; and the bad neighborhood to be avoided is our own scurvy selves. I
  know one or two families, at least, in this town, who, for nearly a generation, have
  been wishing to sell their houses in the outskirts and move into the village, but have
  not been able to accomplish it, and only death will set them free.</p>

  <p>Granted that the majority are able at last either to own or hire the modern house
  with all its improvements. While civilization has been improving our houses, it has not
  equally improved the men who are to inhabit them. It has created palaces, but it was
  not so easy to create noblemen and kings. And <i>if the civilized man's pursuits are no
  worthier than the savage's, if he is employed the greater part of his life in obtaining
  gross necessaries and comforts merely, why should he have a better dwelling than the
  former?</i></p>

  <p>But how do the poor minority fare? Perhaps it will be found that just in proportion
  as some have been placed in outward circumstances above the savage, others have been
  degraded below him. The luxury of one class is counterbalanced by the indigence of
  another. On the one side is the palace, on the other are the almshouse and "silent
  poor." The myriads who built the pyramids to be the tombs of the Pharaohs were fed on
  garlic, and it may be were not decently buried themselves. The mason who finishes the
  cornice of the palace returns at night perchance to a hut not so good as a wigwam. It
  is a mistake to suppose that, in a country where the usual evidences of civilization
  exist, the condition of a very large body of the inhabitants may not be as degraded as
  that of savages. I refer to the degraded poor, not now to the degraded rich. To know
  this I should not need to look farther than to the shanties which everywhere border our
  railroads, that last improvement in civilization; where I see in my daily walks human
  beings living in sties, and all winter with an open door, for the sake of light,
  without any visible, often imaginable, wood-pile, and the forms of both old and young
  are permanently contracted by the long habit of shrinking from cold and misery, and the
  development of all their limbs and faculties is checked. It certainly is fair to look
  at that class by whose labor the works which distinguish this generation are
  accomplished. Such too, to a greater or less extent, is the condition of the operatives
  of every denomination in England, which is the great workhouse of the world. Or I could
  refer you to Ireland, which is marked as one of the white or enlightened spots on the
  map. Contrast the physical condition of the Irish with that of the North American
  Indian, or the South Sea Islander, or any other savage race before it was degraded by
  contact with the civilized man. Yet I have no doubt that that people's rulers are as
  wise as the average of civilized rulers. Their condition only proves what squalidness
  may consist with civilization. I hardly need refer now to the laborers in our Southern
  States who produce the staple exports of this country, and are themselves a staple
  production of the South. But to confine myself to those who are said to be in
  <i>moderate</i> circumstances.</p>

  <p>Most men appear never to have considered what a house is, and are actually though
  needlessly poor all their lives because they think that they must have such a one as
  their neighbors have. As if one were to wear any sort of coat which the tailor might
  cut out for him, or, gradually leaving off palm-leaf hat or cap of woodchuck skin,
  complain of hard times because he could not afford to buy him a crown! It is possible
  to invent a house still more convenient and luxurious than we have, which yet all would
  admit that man could not afford to pay for. Shall we always study to obtain more of
  these things, and not sometimes to be content with less? Shall the respectable citizen
  thus gravely teach, by precept and example, the necessity of the young man's providing
  a certain number of superfluous glow-shoes, and umbrellas, and empty guest chambers for
  empty guests, before he dies? Why should not our furniture be as simple as the Arab's
  or the Indian's? When I think of the benefactors of the race, whom we have apotheosized
  as messengers from heaven, bearers of divine gifts to man, I do not see in my mind any
  retinue at their heels, any carload of fashionable furniture. Or what if I were to
  allow&#8212;would it not be a singular allowance?&#8212;that our furniture should be
  more complex than the Arab's, in proportion as we are morally and intellectually his
  superiors! At present our houses are cluttered and defiled with it, and a good
  housewife would sweep out the greater part into the dust hole, and not leave her
  morning's work undone. Morning work! By the blushes of Aurora and the music of Memnon,
  what should be man's <i>morning work</i> in this world? I had three pieces of limestone
  on my desk, but I was terrified to find that they required to be dusted daily, when the
  furniture of my mind was all undusted still, and threw them out the window in disgust.
  How, then, could I have a furnished house? I would rather sit in the open air, for no
  dust gathers on the grass, unless where man has broken ground.</p>

  <p>It is the luxurious and dissipated who set the fashions which the herd so diligently
  follow. The traveller who stops at the best houses, so called, soon discovers this, for
  the publicans presume him to be a Sardanapalus, and if he resigned himself to their
  tender mercies he would soon be completely emasculated. I think that in the railroad
  car we are inclined to spend more on luxury than on safety and convenience, and it
  threatens without attaining these to become no better than a modern drawing-room, with
  its divans, and ottomans, and sun-shades, and a hundred other oriental things, which we
  are taking west with us, invented for the ladies of the harem and the effeminate
  natives of the Celestial Empire, which Jonathan should be ashamed to know the names of.
  I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than be crowded on a velvet
  cushion. I would rather ride on earth in an ox cart, with a free circulation, than go
  to heaven in the fancy car of an excursion train and breathe a <i>malaria</i> all the
  way.</p>

  <p>The very simplicity and nakedness of man's life in the primitive ages imply this
  advantage, at least, that they left him still but a sojourner in nature. When he was
  refreshed with food and sleep, he contemplated his journey again. He dwelt, as it were,
  in a tent in this world, and was either threading the valleys, or crossing the plains,
  or climbing the mountain-tops. But lo! men have become the tools of their tools. The
  man who independently plucked the fruits when he was hungry is become a farmer; and he
  who stood under a tree for shelter, a housekeeper. We now no longer camp as for a
  night, but have settled down on earth and forgotten heaven. We have adopted
  Christianity merely as an improved method of <i>agri</i>-culture. We have built for
  this world a family mansion, and for the next a family tomb. The best works of art are
  the expression of man's struggle to free himself from this condition, but the effect of
  our art is merely to make this low state comfortable and that higher state to be
  forgotten. There is actually no place in this village for a work of <i>fine</i> art, if
  any had come down to us, to stand, for our lives, our houses and streets, furnish no
  proper pedestal for it. There is not a nail to hang a picture on, nor a shelf to
  receive the bust of a hero or a saint. When I consider how our houses are built and
  paid for, or not paid for, and their internal economy managed and sustained, I wonder
  that the floor does not give way under the visitor while he is admiring the gewgaws
  upon the mantelpiece, and let him through into the cellar, to some solid and honest
  though earthy foundation. I cannot but perceive that this so-called rich and refined
  life is a thing jumped at, and I do not get on in the enjoyment of the fine arts which
  adorn it, my attention being wholly occupied with the jump; for I remember that the
  greatest genuine leap, due to human muscles alone, on record, is that of certain
  wandering Arabs, who are said to have cleared twenty-five feet on level ground. Without
  factitious support, man is sure to come to earth again beyond that distance. The first
  question which I am tempted to put to the proprietor of such great impropriety is, Who
  bolsters you? Are you one of the ninety-seven who fail, or the three who succeed?
  Answer me these questions, and then perhaps I may look at your bawbles and find them
  ornamental. The cart before the horse is neither beautiful nor useful. Before we can
  adorn our houses with beautiful objects the walls must be stripped, and our lives must
  be stripped, and beautiful housekeeping and beautiful living be laid for a foundation:
  now, a taste for the beautiful is most cultivated out of doors, where there is no house
  and no housekeeper.</p>

  <p>Old Johnson, in his "Wonder-Working Providence," speaking of the first settlers of
  this town, with whom he was contemporary, tells us that "they burrow themselves in the
  earth for their first shelter under some hillside, and, casting the soil aloft upon
  timber, they make a smoky fire against the earth, at the highest side." They did not
  "provide them houses," says he, "till the earth, by the Lord's blessing, brought forth
  bread to feed them," and the first year's crop was so light that "they were forced to
  cut their bread very thin for a long season." The secretary of the Province of New
  Netherland, writing in Dutch, in 1650, for the information of those who wished to take
  up land there, states more particularly that "those in New Netherland, and especially
  in New England, who have no means to build farmhouses at first according to their
  wishes, dig a square pit in the ground, cellar fashion, six or seven feet deep, as long
  and as broad as they think proper, case the earth inside with wood all round the wall,
  and line the wood with the bark of trees or something else to prevent the caving in of
  the earth; floor this cellar with plank, and wainscot it overhead for a ceiling, raise
  a roof of spars clear up, and cover the spars with bark or green sods, so that they can
  live dry and warm in these houses with their entire families for two, three, and four
  years, it being understood that partitions are run through those cellars which are
  adapted to the size of the family. The wealthy and principal men in New England, in the
  beginning of the colonies, commenced their first dwelling-houses in this fashion for
  two reasons: firstly, in order not to waste time in building, and not to want food the
  next season; secondly, in order not to discourage poor laboring people whom they
  brought over in numbers from Fatherland. In the course of three or four years, when the
  country became adapted to agriculture, they built themselves handsome houses, spending
  on them several thousands."</p>

  <p>In this course which our ancestors took there was a show of prudence at least, as if
  their principle were to satisfy the more pressing wants first. But are the more
  pressing wants satisfied now? When I think of acquiring for myself one of our luxurious
  dwellings, I am deterred, for, so to speak, the country is not yet adapted to
  <i>human</i> culture, and we are still forced to cut our <i>spiritual</i> bread far
  thinner than our forefathers did their wheaten. Not that all architectural ornament is
  to be neglected even in the rudest periods; but let our houses first be lined with
  beauty, where they come in contact with our lives, like the tenement of the shellfish,
  and not overlaid with it. But, alas! I have been inside one or two of them, and know
  what they are lined with.</p>

  <p>Though we are not so degenerate but that we might possibly live in a cave or a
  wigwam or wear skins today, it certainly is better to accept the advantages, though so
  dearly bought, which the invention and industry of mankind offer. In such a
  neighborhood as this, boards and shingles, lime and bricks, are cheaper and more easily
  obtained than suitable caves, or whole logs, or bark in sufficient quantities, or even
  well-tempered clay or flat stones. I speak understandingly on this subject, for I have
  made myself acquainted with it both theoretically and practically. With a little more
  wit we might use these materials so as to become richer than the richest now are, and
  make our civilization a blessing. The civilized man is a more experienced and wiser
  savage. But to make haste to my own experiment.</p>

  <p>Near the end of March, 1845, I borrowed an axe and went down to the woods by Walden
  Pond, nearest to where I intended to build my house, and began to cut down some tall,
  arrowy white pines, still in their youth, for timber. It is difficult to begin without
  borrowing, but perhaps it is the most generous course thus to permit your fellow-men to
  have an interest in your enterprise. The owner of the axe, as he released his hold on
  it, said that it was the apple of his eye; but I returned it sharper than I received
  it. It was a pleasant hillside where I worked, covered with pine woods, through which I
  looked out on the pond, and a small open field in the woods where pines and hickories
  were springing up. The ice in the pond was not yet dissolved, though there were some
  open spaces, and it was all dark-colored and saturated with water. There were some
  slight flurries of snow during the days that I worked there; but for the most part when
  I came out on to the railroad, on my way home, its yellow sand heap stretched away
  gleaming in the hazy atmosphere, and the rails shone in the spring sun, and I heard the
  lark and pewee and other birds already come to commence another year with us. They were
  pleasant spring days, in which the winter of man's discontent was thawing as well as
  the earth, and the life that had lain torpid began to stretch itself. One day, when my
  axe had come off and I had cut a green hickory for a wedge, driving it with a stone,
  and had placed the whole to soak in a pond-hole in order to swell the wood, I saw a
  striped snake run into the water, and he lay on the bottom, apparently without
  inconvenience, as long as I stayed there, or more than a quarter of an hour; perhaps
  because he had not yet fairly come out of the torpid state. It appeared to me that for
  a like reason men remain in their present low and primitive condition; but if they
  should feel the influence of the spring of springs arousing them, they would of
  necessity rise to a higher and more ethereal life. I had previously seen the snakes in
  frosty mornings in my path with portions of their bodies still numb and inflexible,
  waiting for the sun to thaw them. On the 1st of April it rained and melted the ice, and
  in the early part of the day, which was very foggy, I heard a stray goose groping about
  over the pond and cackling as if lost, or like the spirit of the fog.</p>

  <p>So I went on for some days cutting and hewing timber, and also studs and rafters,
  all with my narrow axe, not having many communicable or scholar-like thoughts, singing
  to myself,&#8212;</p>
  <pre>                  Men say they know many things;
                  But lo! they have taken wings&#8212;
                  The arts and sciences,
                  And a thousand appliances;
                  The wind that blows
                  Is all that any body knows.
</pre>

  <p class="nind">I hewed the main timbers six inches square, most of the studs on two
  sides only, and the rafters and floor timbers on one side, leaving the rest of the bark
  on, so that they were just as straight and much stronger than sawed ones. Each stick
  was carefully mortised or tenoned by its stump, for I had borrowed other tools by this
  time. My days in the woods were not very long ones; yet I usually carried my dinner of
  bread and butter, and read the newspaper in which it was wrapped, at noon, sitting amid
  the green pine boughs which I had cut off, and to my bread was imparted some of their
  fragrance, for my hands were covered with a thick coat of pitch. Before I had done I
  was more the friend than the foe of the pine tree, though I had cut down some of them,
  having become better acquainted with it. Sometimes a rambler in the wood was attracted
  by the sound of my axe, and we chatted pleasantly over the chips which I had made.</p>

  <p>By the middle of April, for I made no haste in my work, but rather made the most of
  it, my house was framed and ready for the raising. I had already bought the shanty of
  James Collins, an Irishman who worked on the Fitchburg Railroad, for boards. James
  Collins' shanty was considered an uncommonly fine one. When I called to see it he was
  not at home. I walked about the outside, at first unobserved from within, the window
  was so deep and high. It was of small dimensions, with a peaked cottage roof, and not
  much else to be seen, the dirt being raised five feet all around as if it were a
  compost heap. The roof was the soundest part, though a good deal warped and made
  brittle by the sun. Doorsill there was none, but a perennial passage for the hens under
  the door board. Mrs. C. came to the door and asked me to view it from the inside. The
  hens were driven in by my approach. It was dark, and had a dirt floor for the most
  part, dank, clammy, and aguish, only here a board and there a board which would not
  bear removal. She lighted a lamp to show me the inside of the roof and the walls, and
  also that the board floor extended under the bed, warning me not to step into the
  cellar, a sort of dust hole two feet deep. In her own words, they were "good boards
  overhead, good boards all around, and a good window"&#8212;of two whole squares
  originally, only the cat had passed out that way lately. There was a stove, a bed, and
  a place to sit, an infant in the house where it was born, a silk parasol, gilt-framed
  looking-glass, and a patent new coffee-mill nailed to an oak sapling, all told. The
  bargain was soon concluded, for James had in the meanwhile returned. I to pay four
  dollars and twenty-five cents tonight, he to vacate at five tomorrow morning, selling
  to nobody else meanwhile: I to take possession at six. It were well, he said, to be
  there early, and anticipate certain indistinct but wholly unjust claims on the score of
  ground rent and fuel. This he assured me was the only encumbrance. At six I passed him
  and his family on the road. One large bundle held their all&#8212;bed, coffee-mill,
  looking-glass, hens&#8212;all but the cat; she took to the woods and became a wild cat,
  and, as I learned afterward, trod in a trap set for woodchucks, and so became a dead
  cat at last.</p>

  <p>I took down this dwelling the same morning, drawing the nails, and removed it to the
  pond-side by small cartloads, spreading the boards on the grass there to bleach and
  warp back again in the sun. One early thrush gave me a note or two as I drove along the
  woodland path. I was informed treacherously by a young Patrick that neighbor Seeley, an
  Irishman, in the intervals of the carting, transferred the still tolerable, straight,
  and drivable nails, staples, and spikes to his pocket, and then stood when I came back
  to pass the time of day, and look freshly up, unconcerned, with spring thoughts, at the
  devastation; there being a dearth of work, as he said. He was there to represent
  spectatordom, and help make this seemingly insignificant event one with the removal of
  the gods of Troy.</p>

  <p>I dug my cellar in the side of a hill sloping to the south, where a woodchuck had
  formerly dug his burrow, down through sumach and blackberry roots, and the lowest stain
  of vegetation, six feet square by seven deep, to a fine sand where potatoes would not
  freeze in any winter. The sides were left shelving, and not stoned; but the sun having
  never shone on them, the sand still keeps its place. It was but two hours' work. I took
  particular pleasure in this breaking of ground, for in almost all latitudes men dig
  into the earth for an equable temperature. Under the most splendid house in the city is
  still to be found the cellar where they store their roots as of old, and long after the
  superstructure has disappeared posterity remark its dent in the earth. The house is
  still but a sort of porch at the entrance of a burrow.</p>

  <p>At length, in the beginning of May, with the help of some of my acquaintances,
  rather to improve so good an occasion for neighborliness than from any necessity, I set
  up the frame of my house. No man was ever more honored in the character of his raisers
  than I. They are destined, I trust, to assist at the raising of loftier structures one
  day. I began to occupy my house on the 4th of July, as soon as it was boarded and
  roofed, for the boards were carefully feather-edged and lapped, so that it was
  perfectly impervious to rain, but before boarding I laid the foundation of a chimney at
  one end, bringing two cartloads of stones up the hill from the pond in my arms. I built
  the chimney after my hoeing in the fall, before a fire became necessary for warmth,
  doing my cooking in the meanwhile out of doors on the ground, early in the morning:
  which mode I still think is in some respects more convenient and agreeable than the
  usual one. When it stormed before my bread was baked, I fixed a few boards over the
  fire, and sat under them to watch my loaf, and passed some pleasant hours in that way.
  In those days, when my hands were much employed, I read but little, but the least
  scraps of paper which lay on the ground, my holder, or tablecloth, afforded me as much
  entertainment, in fact answered the same purpose as the Iliad.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>It would be worth the while to build still more deliberately than I did,
  considering, for instance, what foundation a door, a window, a cellar, a garret, have
  in the nature of man, and perchance never raising any superstructure until we found a
  better reason for it than our temporal necessities even. There is some of the same
  fitness in a man's building his own house that there is in a bird's building its own
  nest. Who knows but if men constructed their dwellings with their own hands, and
  provided food for themselves and families simply and honestly enough, the poetic
  faculty would be universally developed, as birds universally sing when they are so
  engaged? But alas! we do like cowbirds and cuckoos, which lay their eggs in nests which
  other birds have built, and cheer no traveller with their chattering and unmusical
  notes. Shall we forever resign the pleasure of construction to the carpenter? What does
  architecture amount to in the experience of the mass of men? I never in all my walks
  came across a man engaged in so simple and natural an occupation as building his house.
  We belong to the community. It is not the tailor alone who is the ninth part of a man;
  it is as much the preacher, and the merchant, and the farmer. Where is this division of
  labor to end? and what object does it finally serve? No doubt another <i>may</i> also
  think for me; but it is not therefore desirable that he should do so to the exclusion
  of my thinking for myself.</p>

  <p>True, there are architects so called in this country, and I have heard of one at
  least possessed with the idea of making architectural ornaments have a core of truth, a
  necessity, and hence a beauty, as if it were a revelation to him. All very well perhaps
  from his point of view, but only a little better than the common dilettantism. A
  sentimental reformer in architecture, he began at the cornice, not at the foundation.
  It was only how to put a core of truth within the ornaments, that every sugarplum, in
  fact, might have an almond or caraway seed in it&#8212;though I hold that almonds are
  most wholesome without the sugar&#8212;and not how the inhabitant, the indweller, might
  build truly within and without, and let the ornaments take care of themselves. What
  reasonable man ever supposed that ornaments were something outward and in the skin
  merely&#8212;that the tortoise got his spotted shell, or the shell-fish its
  mother-o'-pearl tints, by such a contract as the inhabitants of Broadway their Trinity
  Church? But a man has no more to do with the style of architecture of his house than a
  tortoise with that of its shell: nor need the soldier be so idle as to try to paint the
  precise color of his virtue on his standard. The enemy will find it out. He may turn
  pale when the trial comes. This man seemed to me to lean over the cornice, and timidly
  whisper his half truth to the rude occupants who really knew it better than he. What of
  architectural beauty I now see, I know has gradually grown from within outward, out of
  the necessities and character of the indweller, who is the only builder&#8212;out of
  some unconscious truthfulness, and nobleness, without ever a thought for the appearance
  and whatever additional beauty of this kind is destined to be produced will be preceded
  by a like unconscious beauty of life. The most interesting dwellings in this country,
  as the painter knows, are the most unpretending, humble log huts and cottages of the
  poor commonly; it is the life of the inhabitants whose shells they are, and not any
  peculiarity in their surfaces merely, which makes them picturesque; and equally
  interesting will be the citizen's suburban box, when his life shall be as simple and as
  agreeable to the imagination, and there is as little straining after effect in the
  style of his dwelling. A great proportion of architectural ornaments are literally
  hollow, and a September gale would strip them off, like borrowed plumes, without injury
  to the substantials. They can do without architecture who have no olives nor wines in
  the cellar. What if an equal ado were made about the ornaments of style in literature,
  and the architects of our bibles spent as much time about their cornices as the
  architects of our churches do? So are made the <i>belles-lettres</i> and the
  <i>beaux-arts</i> and their professors. Much it concerns a man, forsooth, how a few
  sticks are slanted over him or under him, and what colors are daubed upon his box. It
  would signify somewhat, if, in any earnest sense, he slanted them and daubed it; but
  the spirit having departed out of the tenant, it is of a piece with constructing his
  own coffin&#8212;the architecture of the grave&#8212;and "carpenter" is but another
  name for "coffin-maker." One man says, in his despair or indifference to life, take up
  a handful of the earth at your feet, and paint your house that color. Is he thinking of
  his last and narrow house? Toss up a copper for it as well. What an abundance of
  leisure be must have! Why do you take up a handful of dirt? Better paint your house
  your own complexion; let it turn pale or blush for you. An enterprise to improve the
  style of cottage architecture! When you have got my ornaments ready, I will wear
  them.</p>

  <p>Before winter I built a chimney, and shingled the sides of my house, which were
  already impervious to rain, with imperfect and sappy shingles made of the first slice
  of the log, whose edges I was obliged to straighten with a plane.</p>

  <p>I have thus a tight shingled and plastered house, ten feet wide by fifteen long, and
  eight-feet posts, with a garret and a closet, a large window on each side, two trap
  doors, one door at the end, and a brick fireplace opposite. The exact cost of my house,
  paying the usual price for such materials as I used, but not counting the work, all of
  which was done by myself, was as follows; and I give the details because very few are
  able to tell exactly what their houses cost, and fewer still, if any, the separate cost
  of the various materials which compose them:&#8212;</p>
  <pre>    Boards.......................... $ 8.03-1/2;, mostly shanty boards.
    Refuse shingles for roof sides...  4.00
    Laths............................  1.25
    Two second-hand windows
       with glass....................  2.43
    One thousand old brick...........  4.00
    Two casks of lime................  2.40  That was high.
    Hair.............................  0.31  More than I needed.
    Mantle-tree iron.................  0.15
    Nails............................  3.90
    Hinges and screws................  0.14
    Latch............................  0.10
    Chalk............................  0.01
    Transportation...................  1.40  I carried a good part
                                     &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; on my back.
        In all...................... $28.12-1/2
</pre>

  <p class="nind">These are all the materials, excepting the timber, stones, and sand,
  which I claimed by squatter's right. I have also a small woodshed adjoining, made
  chiefly of the stuff which was left after building the house.</p>

  <p>I intend to build me a house which will surpass any on the main street in Concord in
  grandeur and luxury, as soon as it pleases me as much and will cost me no more than my
  present one.</p>

  <p>I thus found that the student who wishes for a shelter can obtain one for a lifetime
  at an expense not greater than the rent which he now pays annually. If I seem to boast
  more than is becoming, my excuse is that I brag for humanity rather than for myself;
  and my shortcomings and inconsistencies do not affect the truth of my statement.
  Notwithstanding much cant and hypocrisy&#8212;chaff which I find it difficult to
  separate from my wheat, but for which I am as sorry as any man&#8212;I will breathe
  freely and stretch myself in this respect, it is such a relief to both the moral and
  physical system; and I am resolved that I will not through humility become the devil's
  attorney. I will endeavor to speak a good word for the truth. At Cambridge College the
  mere rent of a student's room, which is only a little larger than my own, is thirty
  dollars each year, though the corporation had the advantage of building thirty-two side
  by side and under one roof, and the occupant suffers the inconvenience of many and
  noisy neighbors, and perhaps a residence in the fourth story. I cannot but think that
  if we had more true wisdom in these respects, not only less education would be needed,
  because, forsooth, more would already have been acquired, but the pecuniary expense of
  getting an education would in a great measure vanish. Those conveniences which the
  student requires at Cambridge or elsewhere cost him or somebody else ten times as great
  a sacrifice of life as they would with proper management on both sides. Those things
  for which the most money is demanded are never the things which the student most wants.
  Tuition, for instance, is an important item in the term bill, while for the far more
  valuable education which he gets by associating with the most cultivated of his
  contemporaries no charge is made. The mode of founding a college is, commonly, to get
  up a subscription of dollars and cents, and then, following blindly the principles of a
  division of labor to its extreme&#8212;a principle which should never be followed but
  with circumspection&#8212;to call in a contractor who makes this a subject of
  speculation, and he employs Irishmen or other operatives actually to lay the
  foundations, while the students that are to be are said to be fitting themselves for
  it; and for these oversights successive generations have to pay. I think that it would
  be better <i>than this</i>, for the students, or those who desire to be benefited by
  it, even to lay the foundation themselves. The student who secures his coveted leisure
  and retirement by systematically shirking any labor necessary to man obtains but an
  ignoble and unprofitable leisure, defrauding himself of the experience which alone can
  make leisure fruitful. "But," says one, "you do not mean that the students should go to
  work with their hands instead of their heads?" I do not mean that exactly, but I mean
  something which he might think a good deal like that; I mean that they should not
  <i>play</i> life, or <i>study</i> it merely, while the community supports them at this
  expensive game, but earnestly live it from beginning to end. How could youths better
  learn to live than by at once trying the experiment of living? Methinks this would
  exercise their minds as much as mathematics. If I wished a boy to know something about
  the arts and sciences, for instance, I would not pursue the common course, which is
  merely to send him into the neighborhood of some professor, where anything is professed
  and practised but the art of life;&#8212;to survey the world through a telescope or a
  microscope, and never with his natural eye; to study chemistry, and not learn how his
  bread is made, or mechanics, and not learn how it is earned; to discover new satellites
  to Neptune, and not detect the motes in his eyes, or to what vagabond he is a satellite
  himself; or to be devoured by the monsters that swarm all around him, while
  contemplating the monsters in a drop of vinegar. Which would have advanced the most at
  the end of a month&#8212;the boy who had made his own jackknife from the ore which he
  had dug and smelted, reading as much as would be necessary for this&#8212;or the boy
  who had attended the lectures on metallurgy at the Institute in the meanwhile, and had
  received a Rodgers' penknife from his father? Which would be most likely to cut his
  fingers?... To my astonishment I was informed on leaving college that I had studied
  navigation!&#8212;why, if I had taken one turn down the harbor I should have known more
  about it. Even the poor student studies and is taught only <i>political</i> economy,
  while that economy of living which is synonymous with philosophy is not even sincerely
  professed in our colleges. The consequence is, that while he is reading Adam Smith,
  Ricardo, and Say, he runs his father in debt irretrievably.</p>

  <p>As with our colleges, so with a hundred "modern improvements"; there is an illusion
  about them; there is not always a positive advance. The devil goes on exacting compound
  interest to the last for his early share and numerous succeeding investments in them.
  Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious
  things. They are but improved means to an unimproved end, an end which it was already
  but too easy to arrive at; as railroads lead to Boston or New York. We are in great
  haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it
  may be, have nothing important to communicate. Either is in such a predicament as the
  man who was earnest to be introduced to a distinguished deaf woman, but when he was
  presented, and one end of her ear trumpet was put into his hand, had nothing to say. As
  if the main object were to talk fast and not to talk sensibly. We are eager to tunnel
  under the Atlantic and bring the Old World some weeks nearer to the New; but perchance
  the first news that will leak through into the broad, flapping American ear will be
  that the Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough. After all, the man whose horse trots
  a mile in a minute does not carry the most important messages; he is not an evangelist,
  nor does he come round eating locusts and wild honey. I doubt if Flying Childers ever
  carried a peck of corn to mill.</p>

  <p>One says to me, "I wonder that you do not lay up money; you love to travel; you
  might take the cars and go to Fitchburg today and see the country." But I am wiser than
  that. I have learned that the swiftest traveller is he that goes afoot. I say to my
  friend, Suppose we try who will get there first. The distance is thirty miles; the fare
  ninety cents. That is almost a day's wages. I remember when wages were sixty cents a
  day for laborers on this very road. Well, I start now on foot, and get there before
  night; I have travelled at that rate by the week together. You will in the meanwhile
  have earned your fare, and arrive there some time tomorrow, or possibly this evening,
  if you are lucky enough to get a job in season. Instead of going to Fitchburg, you will
  be working here the greater part of the day. And so, if the railroad reached round the
  world, I think that I should keep ahead of you; and as for seeing the country and
  getting experience of that kind, I should have to cut your acquaintance altogether.</p>

  <p>Such is the universal law, which no man can ever outwit, and with regard to the
  railroad even we may say it is as broad as it is long. To make a railroad round the
  world available to all mankind is equivalent to grading the whole surface of the
  planet. Men have an indistinct notion that if they keep up this activity of joint
  stocks and spades long enough all will at length ride somewhere, in next to no time,
  and for nothing; but though a crowd rushes to the depot, and the conductor shouts "All
  aboard!" when the smoke is blown away and the vapor condensed, it will be perceived
  that a few are riding, but the rest are run over&#8212;and it will be called, and will
  be, "A melancholy accident." No doubt they can ride at last who shall have earned their
  fare, that is, if they survive so long, but they will probably have lost their
  elasticity and desire to travel by that time. This spending of the best part of one's
  life earning money in order to enjoy a questionable liberty during the least valuable
  part of it reminds me of the Englishman who went to India to make a fortune first, in
  order that he might return to England and live the life of a poet. He should have gone
  up garret at once. "What!" exclaim a million Irishmen starting up from all the shanties
  in the land, "is not this railroad which we have built a good thing?" Yes, I answer,
  comparatively good, that is, you might have done worse; but I wish, as you are brothers
  of mine, that you could have spent your time better than digging in this dirt.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>Before I finished my house, wishing to earn ten or twelve dollars by some honest and
  agreeable method, in order to meet my unusual expenses, I planted about two acres and a
  half of light and sandy soil near it chiefly with beans, but also a small part with
  potatoes, corn, peas, and turnips. The whole lot contains eleven acres, mostly growing
  up to pines and hickories, and was sold the preceding season for eight dollars and
  eight cents an acre. One farmer said that it was "good for nothing but to raise
  cheeping squirrels on." I put no manure whatever on this land, not being the owner, but
  merely a squatter, and not expecting to cultivate so much again, and I did not quite
  hoe it all once. I got out several cords of stumps in plowing, which supplied me with
  fuel for a long time, and left small circles of virgin mould, easily distinguishable
  through the summer by the greater luxuriance of the beans there. The dead and for the
  most part unmerchantable wood behind my house, and the driftwood from the pond, have
  supplied the remainder of my fuel. I was obliged to hire a team and a man for the
  plowing, though I held the plow myself. My farm outgoes for the first season were, for
  implements, seed, work, etc., $14.72-1/2. The seed corn was given me. This never costs
  anything to speak of, unless you plant more than enough. I got twelve bushels of beans,
  and eighteen bushels of potatoes, beside some peas and sweet corn. The yellow corn and
  turnips were too late to come to anything. My whole income from the farm was</p>
  <pre>                                       $ 23.44
      Deducting the outgoes............  14.72-1/2
                                         &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;
      There are left.................. $  8.71-1/2
</pre>

  <p class="nind">beside produce consumed and on hand at the time this estimate was made
  of the value of $4.50&#8212;the amount on hand much more than balancing a little grass
  which I did not raise. All things considered, that is, considering the importance of a
  man's soul and of today, notwithstanding the short time occupied by my experiment, nay,
  partly even because of its transient character, I believe that that was doing better
  than any farmer in Concord did that year.</p>

  <p>The next year I did better still, for I spaded up all the land which I required,
  about a third of an acre, and I learned from the experience of both years, not being in
  the least awed by many celebrated works on husbandry, Arthur Young among the rest, that
  if one would live simply and eat only the crop which he raised, and raise no more than
  he ate, and not exchange it for an insufficient quantity of more luxurious and
  expensive things, he would need to cultivate only a few rods of ground, and that it
  would be cheaper to spade up that than to use oxen to plow it, and to select a fresh
  spot from time to time than to manure the old, and he could do all his necessary farm
  work as it were with his left hand at odd hours in the summer; and thus he would not be
  tied to an ox, or horse, or cow, or pig, as at present. I desire to speak impartially
  on this point, and as one not interested in the success or failure of the present
  economical and social arrangements. I was more independent than any farmer in Concord,
  for I was not anchored to a house or farm, but could follow the bent of my genius,
  which is a very crooked one, every moment. Beside being better off than they already,
  if my house had been burned or my crops had failed, I should have been nearly as well
  off as before.</p>

  <p>I am wont to think that men are not so much the keepers of herds as herds are the
  keepers of men, the former are so much the freer. Men and oxen exchange work; but if we
  consider necessary work only, the oxen will be seen to have greatly the advantage,
  their farm is so much the larger. Man does some of his part of the exchange work in his
  six weeks of haying, and it is no boy's play. Certainly no nation that lived simply in
  all respects, that is, no nation of philosophers, would commit so great a blunder as to
  use the labor of animals. True, there never was and is not likely soon to be a nation
  of philosophers, nor am I certain it is desirable that there should be. However,
  <i>I</i> should never have broken a horse or bull and taken him to board for any work
  he might do for me, for fear I should become a horseman or a herdsman merely; and if
  society seems to be the gainer by so doing, are we certain that what is one man's gain
  is not another's loss, and that the stable-boy has equal cause with his master to be
  satisfied? Granted that some public works would not have been constructed without this
  aid, and let man share the glory of such with the ox and horse; does it follow that he
  could not have accomplished works yet more worthy of himself in that case? When men
  begin to do, not merely unnecessary or artistic, but luxurious and idle work, with
  their assistance, it is inevitable that a few do all the exchange work with the oxen,
  or, in other words, become the slaves of the strongest. Man thus not only works for the
  animal within him, but, for a symbol of this, he works for the animal without him.
  Though we have many substantial houses of brick or stone, the prosperity of the farmer
  is still measured by the degree to which the barn overshadows the house. This town is
  said to have the largest houses for oxen, cows, and horses hereabouts, and it is not
  behindhand in its public buildings; but there are very few halls for free worship or
  free speech in this county. It should not be by their architecture, but why not even by
  their power of abstract thought, that nations should seek to commemorate themselves?
  How much more admirable the Bhagvat-Geeta than all the ruins of the East! Towers and
  temples are the luxury of princes. A simple and independent mind does not toil at the
  bidding of any prince. Genius is not a retainer to any emperor, nor is its material
  silver, or gold, or marble, except to a trifling extent. To what end, pray, is so much
  stone hammered? In Arcadia, when I was there, I did not see any hammering stone.
  Nations are possessed with an insane ambition to perpetuate the memory of themselves by
  the amount of hammered stone they leave. What if equal pains were taken to smooth and
  polish their manners? One piece of good sense would be more memorable than a monument
  as high as the moon. I love better to see stones in place. The grandeur of Thebes was a
  vulgar grandeur. More sensible is a rod of stone wall that bounds an honest man's field
  than a hundred-gated Thebes that has wandered farther from the true end of life. The
  religion and civilization which are barbaric and heathenish build splendid temples; but
  what you might call Christianity does not. Most of the stone a nation hammers goes
  toward its tomb only. It buries itself alive. As for the Pyramids, there is nothing to
  wonder at in them so much as the fact that so many men could be found degraded enough
  to spend their lives constructing a tomb for some ambitious booby, whom it would have
  been wiser and manlier to have drowned in the Nile, and then given his body to the
  dogs. I might possibly invent some excuse for them and him, but I have no time for it.
  As for the religion and love of art of the builders, it is much the same all the world
  over, whether the building be an Egyptian temple or the United States Bank. It costs
  more than it comes to. The mainspring is vanity, assisted by the love of garlic and
  bread and butter. Mr. Balcom, a promising young architect, designs it on the back of
  his Vitruvius, with hard pencil and ruler, and the job is let out to Dobson &amp; Sons,
  stonecutters. When the thirty centuries begin to look down on it, mankind begin to look
  up at it. As for your high towers and monuments, there was a crazy fellow once in this
  town who undertook to dig through to China, and he got so far that, as he said, he
  heard the Chinese pots and kettles rattle; but I think that I shall not go out of my
  way to admire the hole which he made. Many are concerned about the monuments of the
  West and the East&#8212;to know who built them. For my part, I should like to know who
  in those days did not build them&#8212;who were above such trifling. But to proceed
  with my statistics.</p>

  <p>By surveying, carpentry, and day-labor of various other kinds in the village in the
  meanwhile, for I have as many trades as fingers, I had earned $13.34. The expense of
  food for eight months, namely, from July 4th to March 1st, the time when these
  estimates were made, though I lived there more than two years&#8212;not counting
  potatoes, a little green corn, and some peas, which I had raised, nor considering the

  <p class="nind">Yes, I did eat $8.74, all told; but I should not thus unblushingly
  publish my guilt, if I did not know that most of my readers were equally guilty with
  myself, and that their deeds would look no better in print. The next year I sometimes
  caught a mess of fish for my dinner, and once I went so far as to slaughter a woodchuck
  which ravaged my bean-field&#8212;effect his transmigration, as a Tartar would
  say&#8212;and devour him, partly for experiment's sake; but though it afforded me a
  momentary enjoyment, notwithstanding a musky flavor, I saw that the longest use would
  not make that a good practice, however it might seem to have your woodchucks ready
  dressed by the village butcher.</p>

  <p>Clothing and some incidental expenses within the same dates, though little can be
  inferred from this item, amounted to</p>
  <pre>                                            $8.40-3/4

  <p class="nind">which subtracted from the sum of the outgoes leaves a balance of
  $25.21-3/4 on the one side&#8212;this being very nearly the means with which I started,
  and the measure of expenses to be incurred&#8212;and on the other, beside the leisure
  and independence and health thus secured, a comfortable house for me as long as I
  choose to occupy it.</p>

  <p>These statistics, however accidental and therefore uninstructive they may appear, as
  they have a certain completeness, have a certain value also. Nothing was given me of
  which I have not rendered some account. It appears from the above estimate, that my
  food alone cost me in money about twenty-seven cents a week. It was, for nearly two
  years after this, rye and Indian meal without yeast, potatoes, rice, a very little salt
  pork, molasses, and salt; and my drink, water. It was fit that I should live on rice,
  mainly, who love so well the philosophy of India. To meet the objections of some
  inveterate cavillers, I may as well state, that if I dined out occasionally, as I
  always had done, and I trust shall have opportunities to do again, it was frequently to
  the detriment of my domestic arrangements. But the dining out, being, as I have stated,
  a constant element, does not in the least affect a comparative statement like this.</p>

  <p>I learned from my two years' experience that it would cost incredibly little trouble
  to obtain one's necessary food, even in this latitude; that a man may use as simple a
  diet as the animals, and yet retain health and strength. I have made a satisfactory
  dinner, satisfactory on several accounts, simply off a dish of purslane (<i>Portulaca
  oleracea</i>) which I gathered in my cornfield, boiled and salted. I give the Latin on
  account of the savoriness of the trivial name. And pray what more can a reasonable man
  desire, in peaceful times, in ordinary noons, than a sufficient number of ears of green
  sweet corn boiled, with the addition of salt? Even the little variety which I used was
  a yielding to the demands of appetite, and not of health. Yet men have come to such a
  pass that they frequently starve, not for want of necessaries, but for want of
  luxuries; and I know a good woman who thinks that her son lost his life because he took
  to drinking water only.</p>

  <p>The reader will perceive that I am treating the subject rather from an economic than
  a dietetic point of view, and he will not venture to put my abstemiousness to the test
  unless he has a well-stocked larder.</p>

  <p>Bread I at first made of pure Indian meal and salt, genuine hoe-cakes, which I baked
  before my fire out of doors on a shingle or the end of a stick of timber sawed off in
  building my house; but it was wont to get smoked and to have a piny flavor. I tried
  flour also; but have at last found a mixture of rye and Indian meal most convenient and
  agreeable. In cold weather it was no little amusement to bake several small loaves of
  this in succession, tending and turning them as carefully as an Egyptian his hatching
  eggs. They were a real cereal fruit which I ripened, and they had to my senses a
  fragrance like that of other noble fruits, which I kept in as long as possible by
  wrapping them in cloths. I made a study of the ancient and indispensable art of
  bread-making, consulting such authorities as offered, going back to the primitive days
  and first invention of the unleavened kind, when from the wildness of nuts and meats
  men first reached the mildness and refinement of this diet, and travelling gradually
  down in my studies through that accidental souring of the dough which, it is supposed,
  taught the leavening process, and through the various fermentations thereafter, till I
  came to "good, sweet, wholesome bread," the staff of life. Leaven, which some deem the
  soul of bread, the <i>spiritus</i> which fills its cellular tissue, which is
  religiously preserved like the vestal fire&#8212;some precious bottleful, I suppose,
  first brought over in the Mayflower, did the business for America, and its influence is
  still rising, swelling, spreading, in cerealian billows over the land&#8212;this seed I
  regularly and faithfully procured from the village, till at length one morning I forgot
  the rules, and scalded my yeast; by which accident I discovered that even this was not
  indispensable&#8212;for my discoveries were not by the synthetic but analytic
  process&#8212;and I have gladly omitted it since, though most housewives earnestly
  assured me that safe and wholesome bread without yeast might not be, and elderly people
  prophesied a speedy decay of the vital forces. Yet I find it not to be an essential
  ingredient, and after going without it for a year am still in the land of the living;
  and I am glad to escape the trivialness of carrying a bottleful in my pocket, which
  would sometimes pop and discharge its contents to my discomfiture. It is simpler and
  more respectable to omit it. Man is an animal who more than any other can adapt himself
  to all climates and circumstances. Neither did I put any sal-soda, or other acid or
  alkali, into my bread. It would seem that I made it according to the recipe which
  Marcus Porcius Cato gave about two centuries before Christ. "Panem depsticium sic
  facito. Manus mortariumque bene lavato. Farinam in mortarium indito, aquae paulatim
  addito, subigitoque pulchre. Ubi bene subegeris, defingito, coquitoque sub testu."
  Which I take to mean,&#8212;"Make kneaded bread thus. Wash your hands and trough well.
  Put the meal into the trough, add water gradually, and knead it thoroughly. When you
  have kneaded it well, mould it, and bake it under a cover," that is, in a baking
  kettle. Not a word about leaven. But I did not always use this staff of life. At one
  time, owing to the emptiness of my purse, I saw none of it for more than a month.</p>

  <p>Every New Englander might easily raise all his own breadstuffs in this land of rye
  and Indian corn, and not depend on distant and fluctuating markets for them. Yet so far
  are we from simplicity and independence that, in Concord, fresh and sweet meal is
  rarely sold in the shops, and hominy and corn in a still coarser form are hardly used
  by any. For the most part the farmer gives to his cattle and hogs the grain of his own
  producing, and buys flour, which is at least no more wholesome, at a greater cost, at
  the store. I saw that I could easily raise my bushel or two of rye and Indian corn, for
  the former will grow on the poorest land, and the latter does not require the best, and
  grind them in a hand-mill, and so do without rice and pork; and if I must have some
  concentrated sweet, I found by experiment that I could make a very good molasses either
  of pumpkins or beets, and I knew that I needed only to set out a few maples to obtain
  it more easily still, and while these were growing I could use various substitutes
  beside those which I have named. "For," as the Forefathers sang,&#8212;</p>
  <pre>                "we can make liquor to sweeten our lips
        Of pumpkins and parsnips and walnut-tree chips."
</pre>

  <p class="nind">Finally, as for salt, that grossest of groceries, to obtain this might
  be a fit occasion for a visit to the seashore, or, if I did without it altogether, I
  should probably drink the less water. I do not learn that the Indians ever troubled
  themselves to go after it.</p>

  <p>Thus I could avoid all trade and barter, so far as my food was concerned, and having
  a shelter already, it would only remain to get clothing and fuel. The pantaloons which
  I now wear were woven in a farmer's family&#8212;thank Heaven there is so much virtue
  still in man; for I think the fall from the farmer to the operative as great and
  memorable as that from the man to the farmer;&#8212;and in a new country, fuel is an
  encumbrance. As for a habitat, if I were not permitted still to squat, I might purchase
  one acre at the same price for which the land I cultivated was sold&#8212;namely, eight
  dollars and eight cents. But as it was, I considered that I enhanced the value of the
  land by squatting on it.</p>

  <p>There is a certain class of unbelievers who sometimes ask me such questions as, if I
  think that I can live on vegetable food alone; and to strike at the root of the matter
  at once&#8212;for the root is faith&#8212;I am accustomed to answer such, that I can
  live on board nails. If they cannot understand that, they cannot understand much that I
  have to say. For my part, I am glad to hear of experiments of this kind being tried; as
  that a young man tried for a fortnight to live on hard, raw corn on the ear, using his
  teeth for all mortar. The squirrel tribe tried the same and succeeded. The human race
  is interested in these experiments, though a few old women who are incapacitated for
  them, or who own their thirds in mills, may be alarmed.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>My furniture, part of which I made myself&#8212;and the rest cost me nothing of
  which I have not rendered an account&#8212;consisted of a bed, a table, a desk, three
  chairs, a looking-glass three inches in diameter, a pair of tongs and andirons, a
  kettle, a skillet, and a frying-pan, a dipper, a wash-bowl, two knives and forks, three
  plates, one cup, one spoon, a jug for oil, a jug for molasses, and a japanned lamp.
  None is so poor that he need sit on a pumpkin. That is shiftlessness. There is a plenty
  of such chairs as I like best in the village garrets to be had for taking them away.
  Furniture! Thank God, I can sit and I can stand without the aid of a furniture
  warehouse. What man but a philosopher would not be ashamed to see his furniture packed
  in a cart and going up country exposed to the light of heaven and the eyes of men, a
  beggarly account of empty boxes? That is Spaulding's furniture. I could never tell from
  inspecting such a load whether it belonged to a so-called rich man or a poor one; the
  owner always seemed poverty-stricken. Indeed, the more you have of such things the
  poorer you are. Each load looks as if it contained the contents of a dozen shanties;
  and if one shanty is poor, this is a dozen times as poor. Pray, for what do we
  <i>move</i> ever but to get rid of our furniture, our <i>exuvi&#339;</i>: at last to
  go from this world to another newly furnished, and leave this to be burned? It is the
  same as if all these traps were buckled to a man's belt, and he could not move over the
  rough country where our lines are cast without dragging them&#8212;dragging his trap.
  He was a lucky fox that left his tail in the trap. The muskrat will gnaw his third leg
  off to be free. No wonder man has lost his elasticity. How often he is at a dead set!
  "Sir, if I may be so bold, what do you mean by a dead set?" If you are a seer, whenever
  you meet a man you will see all that he owns, ay, and much that he pretends to disown,
  behind him, even to his kitchen furniture and all the trumpery which he saves and will
  not burn, and he will appear to be harnessed to it and making what headway he can. I
  think that the man is at a dead set who has got through a knot-hole or gateway where
  his sledge load of furniture cannot follow him. I cannot but feel compassion when I
  hear some trig, compact-looking man, seemingly free, all girded and ready, speak of his
  "furniture," as whether it is insured or not. "But what shall I do with my
  furniture?"&#8212;My gay butterfly is entangled in a spider's web then. Even those who
  seem for a long while not to have any, if you inquire more narrowly you will find have
  some stored in somebody's barn. I look upon England today as an old gentleman who is
  travelling with a great deal of baggage, trumpery which has accumulated from long
  housekeeping, which he has not the courage to burn; great trunk, little trunk, bandbox,
  and bundle. Throw away the first three at least. It would surpass the powers of a well
  man nowadays to take up his bed and walk, and I should certainly advise a sick one to
  lay down his bed and run. When I have met an immigrant tottering under a bundle which
  contained his all&#8212;looking like an enormous wen which had grown out of the nape of
  his neck&#8212;I have pitied him, not because that was his all, but because he had all
  <i>that</i> to carry. If I have got to drag my trap, I will take care that it be a
  light one and do not nip me in a vital part. But perchance it would be wisest never to
  put one's paw into it.</p>

  <p>I would observe, by the way, that it costs me nothing for curtains, for I have no
  gazers to shut out but the sun and moon, and I am willing that they should look in. The
  moon will not sour milk nor taint meat of mine, nor will the sun injure my furniture or
  fade my carpet; and if he is sometimes too warm a friend, I find it still better
  economy to retreat behind some curtain which nature has provided, than to add a single
  item to the details of housekeeping. A lady once offered me a mat, but as I had no room
  to spare within the house, nor time to spare within or without to shake it, I declined
  it, preferring to wipe my feet on the sod before my door. It is best to avoid the
  beginnings of evil.</p>

  <p>Not long since I was present at the auction of a deacon's effects, for his life had
  not been ineffectual:&#8212;</p>
  <pre>      "The evil that men do lives after them."
</pre>

  <p class="nind">As usual, a great proportion was trumpery which had begun to accumulate
  in his father's day. Among the rest was a dried tapeworm. And now, after lying half a
  century in his garret and other dust holes, these things were not burned; instead of a
  <i>bonfire</i>, or purifying destruction of them, there was an <i>auction</i>, or
  increasing of them. The neighbors eagerly collected to view them, bought them all, and
  carefully transported them to their garrets and dust holes, to lie there till their
  estates are settled, when they will start again. When a man dies he kicks the dust.</p>

  <p>The customs of some savage nations might, perchance, be profitably imitated by us,
  for they at least go through the semblance of casting their slough annually; they have
  the idea of the thing, whether they have the reality or not. Would it not be well if we
  were to celebrate such a "busk," or "feast of first fruits," as Bartram describes to
  have been the custom of the Mucclasse Indians? "When a town celebrates the busk," says
  he, "having previously provided themselves with new clothes, new pots, pans, and other
  household utensils and furniture, they collect all their worn out clothes and other
  despicable things, sweep and cleanse their houses, squares, and the whole town of their
  filth, which with all the remaining grain and other old provisions they cast together
  into one common heap, and consume it with fire. After having taken medicine, and fasted
  for three days, all the fire in the town is extinguished. During this fast they abstain
  from the gratification of every appetite and passion whatever. A general amnesty is
  proclaimed; all malefactors may return to their town."</p>

  <p>"On the fourth morning, the high priest, by rubbing dry wood together, produces new
  fire in the public square, from whence every habitation in the town is supplied with
  the new and pure flame."</p>

  <p>They then feast on the new corn and fruits, and dance and sing for three days, "and
  the four following days they receive visits and rejoice with their friends from
  neighboring towns who have in like manner purified and prepared themselves."</p>

  <p>The Mexicans also practised a similar purification at the end of every fifty-two
  years, in the belief that it was time for the world to come to an end.</p>

  <p>I have scarcely heard of a truer sacrament, that is, as the dictionary defines it,
  "outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace," than this, and I have no
  doubt that they were originally inspired directly from Heaven to do thus, though they
  have no Biblical record of the revelation.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>For more than five years I maintained myself thus solely by the labor of my hands,
  and I found that, by working about six weeks in a year, I could meet all the expenses
  of living. The whole of my winters, as well as most of my summers, I had free and clear
  for study. I have thoroughly tried school-keeping, and found that my expenses were in
  proportion, or rather out of proportion, to my income, for I was obliged to dress and
  train, not to say think and believe, accordingly, and I lost my time into the bargain.
  As I did not teach for the good of my fellow-men, but simply for a livelihood, this was
  a failure. I have tried trade but I found that it would take ten years to get under way
  in that, and that then I should probably be on my way to the devil. I was actually
  afraid that I might by that time be doing what is called a good business. When formerly
  I was looking about to see what I could do for a living, some sad experience in
  conforming to the wishes of friends being fresh in my mind to tax my ingenuity, I
  thought often and seriously of picking huckleberries; that surely I could do, and its
  small profits might suffice&#8212;for my greatest skill has been to want but
  little&#8212;so little capital it required, so little distraction from my wonted moods,
  I foolishly thought. While my acquaintances went unhesitatingly into trade or the
  professions, I contemplated this occupation as most like theirs; ranging the hills all
  summer to pick the berries which came in my way, and thereafter carelessly dispose of
  them; so, to keep the flocks of Admetus. I also dreamed that I might gather the wild
  herbs, or carry evergreens to such villagers as loved to be reminded of the woods, even
  to the city, by hay-cart loads. But I have since learned that trade curses everything
  it handles; and though you trade in messages from heaven, the whole curse of trade
  attaches to the business.</p>

  <p>As I preferred some things to others, and especially valued my freedom, as I could
  fare hard and yet succeed well, I did not wish to spend my time in earning rich carpets
  or other fine furniture, or delicate cookery, or a house in the Grecian or the Gothic
  style just yet. If there are any to whom it is no interruption to acquire these things,
  and who know how to use them when acquired, I relinquish to them the pursuit. Some are
  "industrious," and appear to love labor for its own sake, or perhaps because it keeps
  them out of worse mischief; to such I have at present nothing to say. Those who would
  not know what to do with more leisure than they now enjoy, I might advise to work twice
  as hard as they do&#8212;work till they pay for themselves, and get their free papers.
  For myself I found that the occupation of a day-laborer was the most independent of
  any, especially as it required only thirty or forty days in a year to support one. The
  laborer's day ends with the going down of the sun, and he is then free to devote
  himself to his chosen pursuit, independent of his labor; but his employer, who
  speculates from month to month, has no respite from one end of the year to the
  other.</p>

  <p>In short, I am convinced, both by faith and experience, that to maintain one's self
  on this earth is not a hardship but a pastime, if we will live simply and wisely; as
  the pursuits of the simpler nations are still the sports of the more artificial. It is
  not necessary that a man should earn his living by the sweat of his brow, unless he
  sweats easier than I do.</p>

  <p>One young man of my acquaintance, who has inherited some acres, told me that he
  thought he should live as I did, <i>if he had the means</i>. I would not have any one
  adopt <i>my</i> mode of living on any account; for, beside that before he has fairly
  learned it I may have found out another for myself, I desire that there may be as many
  different persons in the world as possible; but I would have each one be very careful
  to find out and pursue <i>his own</i> way, and not his father's or his mother's or his
  neighbor's instead. The youth may build or plant or sail, only let him not be hindered
  from doing that which he tells me he would like to do. It is by a mathematical point
  only that we are wise, as the sailor or the fugitive slave keeps the polestar in his
  eye; but that is sufficient guidance for all our life. We may not arrive at our port
  within a calculable period, but we would preserve the true course.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly, in this case, what is true for one is truer still for a thousand, as a
  large house is not proportionally more expensive than a small one, since one roof may
  cover, one cellar underlie, and one wall separate several apartments. But for my part,
  I preferred the solitary dwelling. Moreover, it will commonly be cheaper to build the
  whole yourself than to convince another of the advantage of the common wall; and when
  you have done this, the common partition, to be much cheaper, must be a thin one, and
  that other may prove a bad neighbor, and also not keep his side in repair. The only
  co-operation which is commonly possible is exceedingly partial and superficial; and
  what little true co-operation there is, is as if it were not, being a harmony inaudible
  to men. If a man has faith, he will co-operate with equal faith everywhere; if he has
  not faith, he will continue to live like the rest of the world, whatever company he is
  joined to. To co-operate in the highest as well as the lowest sense, means <i>to get
  our living together</i>. I heard it proposed lately that two young men should travel
  together over the world, the one without money, earning his means as he went, before
  the mast and behind the plow, the other carrying a bill of exchange in his pocket. It
  was easy to see that they could not long be companions or co-operate, since one would
  not <i>operate</i> at all. They would part at the first interesting crisis in their
  adventures. Above all, as I have implied, the man who goes alone can start today; but
  he who travels with another must wait till that other is ready, and it may be a long
  time before they get off.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>But all this is very selfish, I have heard some of my townsmen say. I confess that I
  have hitherto indulged very little in philanthropic enterprises. I have made some
  sacrifices to a sense of duty, and among others have sacrificed this pleasure also.
  There are those who have used all their arts to persuade me to undertake the support of
  some poor family in the town; and if I had nothing to do&#8212;for the devil finds
  employment for the idle&#8212;I might try my hand at some such pastime as that.
  However, when I have thought to indulge myself in this respect, and lay their Heaven
  under an obligation by maintaining certain poor persons in all respects as comfortably
  as I maintain myself, and have even ventured so far as to make them the offer, they
  have one and all unhesitatingly preferred to remain poor. While my townsmen and women
  are devoted in so many ways to the good of their fellows, I trust that one at least may
  be spared to other and less humane pursuits. You must have a genius for charity as well
  as for anything else. As for Doing-good, that is one of the professions which are full.
  Moreover, I have tried it fairly, and, strange as it may seem, am satisfied that it
  does not agree with my constitution. Probably I should not consciously and deliberately
  forsake my particular calling to do the good which society demands of me, to save the
  universe from annihilation; and I believe that a like but infinitely greater
  steadfastness elsewhere is all that now preserves it. But I would not stand between any
  man and his genius; and to him who does this work, which I decline, with his whole
  heart and soul and life, I would say, Persevere, even if the world call it doing evil,
  as it is most likely they will.</p>

  <p>I am far from supposing that my case is a peculiar one; no doubt many of my readers
  would make a similar defence. At doing something&#8212;I will not engage that my
  neighbors shall pronounce it good&#8212;I do not hesitate to say that I should be a
  capital fellow to hire; but what that is, it is for my employer to find out. What
  <i>good</i> I do, in the common sense of that word, must be aside from my main path,
  and for the most part wholly unintended. Men say, practically, Begin where you are and
  such as you are, without aiming mainly to become of more worth, and with kindness
  aforethought go about doing good. If I were to preach at all in this strain, I should
  say rather, Set about being good. As if the sun should stop when he had kindled his
  fires up to the splendor of a moon or a star of the sixth magnitude, and go about like
  a Robin Goodfellow, peeping in at every cottage window, inspiring lunatics, and
  tainting meats, and making darkness visible, instead of steadily increasing his genial
  heat and beneficence till he is of such brightness that no mortal can look him in the
  face, and then, and in the meanwhile too, going about the world in his own orbit, doing
  it good, or rather, as a truer philosophy has discovered, the world going about him
  getting good. When Phaeton, wishing to prove his heavenly birth by his beneficence, had
  the sun's chariot but one day, and drove out of the beaten track, he burned several
  blocks of houses in the lower streets of heaven, and scorched the surface of the earth,
  and dried up every spring, and made the great desert of Sahara, till at length Jupiter
  hurled him headlong to the earth with a thunderbolt, and the sun, through grief at his
  death, did not shine for a year.</p>

  <p>There is no odor so bad as that which arises from goodness tainted. It is human, it
  is divine, carrion. If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with
  the conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my life, as from that dry and
  parching wind of the African deserts called the simoom, which fills the mouth and nose
  and ears and eyes with dust till you are suffocated, for fear that I should get some of
  his good done to me&#8212;some of its virus mingled with my blood. No&#8212;in this
  case I would rather suffer evil the natural way. A man is not a good <i>man</i> to me
  because he will feed me if I should be starving, or warm me if I should be freezing, or
  pull me out of a ditch if I should ever fall into one. I can find you a Newfoundland
  dog that will do as much. Philanthropy is not love for one's fellow-man in the broadest
  sense. Howard was no doubt an exceedingly kind and worthy man in his way, and has his
  reward; but, comparatively speaking, what are a hundred Howards to <i>us</i>, if their
  philanthropy do not help us in our best estate, when we are most worthy to be helped? I
  never heard of a philanthropic meeting in which it was sincerely proposed to do any
  good to me, or the like of me.</p>

  <p>The Jesuits were quite balked by those Indians who, being burned at the stake,
  suggested new modes of torture to their tormentors. Being superior to physical
  suffering, it sometimes chanced that they were superior to any consolation which the
  missionaries could offer; and the law to do as you would be done by fell with less
  persuasiveness on the ears of those who, for their part, did not care how they were
  done by, who loved their enemies after a new fashion, and came very near freely
  forgiving them all they did.</p>

  <p>Be sure that you give the poor the aid they most need, though it be your example
  which leaves them far behind. If you give money, spend yourself with it, and do not
  merely abandon it to them. We make curious mistakes sometimes. Often the poor man is
  not so cold and hungry as he is dirty and ragged and gross. It is partly his taste, and
  not merely his misfortune. If you give him money, he will perhaps buy more rags with
  it. I was wont to pity the clumsy Irish laborers who cut ice on the pond, in such mean
  and ragged clothes, while I shivered in my more tidy and somewhat more fashionable
  garments, till, one bitter cold day, one who had slipped into the water came to my
  house to warm him, and I saw him strip off three pairs of pants and two pairs of
  stockings ere he got down to the skin, though they were dirty and ragged enough, it is
  true, and that he could afford to refuse the <i>extra</i> garments which I offered him,
  he had so many <i>intra</i> ones. This ducking was the very thing he needed. Then I
  began to pity myself, and I saw that it would be a greater charity to bestow on me a
  flannel shirt than a whole slop-shop on him. There are a thousand hacking at the
  branches of evil to one who is striking at the root, and it may be that he who bestows
  the largest amount of time and money on the needy is doing the most by his mode of life
  to produce that misery which he strives in vain to relieve. It is the pious
  slave-breeder devoting the proceeds of every tenth slave to buy a Sunday's liberty for
  the rest. Some show their kindness to the poor by employing them in their kitchens.
  Would they not be kinder if they employed themselves there? You boast of spending a
  tenth part of your income in charity; maybe you should spend the nine tenths so, and
  done with it. Society recovers only a tenth part of the property then. Is this owing to
  the generosity of him in whose possession it is found, or to the remissness of the
  officers of justice?</p>

  <p>Philanthropy is almost the only virtue which is sufficiently appreciated by mankind.
  Nay, it is greatly overrated; and it is our selfishness which overrates it. A robust
  poor man, one sunny day here in Concord, praised a fellow-townsman to me, because, as
  he said, he was kind to the poor; meaning himself. The kind uncles and aunts of the
  race are more esteemed than its true spiritual fathers and mothers. I once heard a
  reverend lecturer on England, a man of learning and intelligence, after enumerating her
  scientific, literary, and political worthies, Shakespeare, Bacon, Cromwell, Milton,
  Newton, and others, speak next of her Christian heroes, whom, as if his profession
  required it of him, he elevated to a place far above all the rest, as the greatest of
  the great. They were Penn, Howard, and Mrs. Fry. Every one must feel the falsehood and
  cant of this. The last were not England's best men and women; only, perhaps, her best
  philanthropists.</p>

  <p>I would not subtract anything from the praise that is due to philanthropy, but
  merely demand justice for all who by their lives and works are a blessing to mankind. I
  do not value chiefly a man's uprightness and benevolence, which are, as it were, his
  stem and leaves. Those plants of whose greenness withered we make herb tea for the sick
  serve but a humble use, and are most employed by quacks. I want the flower and fruit of
  a man; that some fragrance be wafted over from him to me, and some ripeness flavor our
  intercourse. His goodness must not be a partial and transitory act, but a constant
  superfluity, which costs him nothing and of which he is unconscious. This is a charity
  that hides a multitude of sins. The philanthropist too often surrounds mankind with the
  remembrance of his own castoff griefs as an atmosphere, and calls it sympathy. We
  should impart our courage, and not our despair, our health and ease, and not our
  disease, and take care that this does not spread by contagion. From what southern
  plains comes up the voice of wailing? Under what latitudes reside the heathen to whom
  we would send light? Who is that intemperate and brutal man whom we would redeem? If
  anything ail a man, so that he does not perform his functions, if he have a pain in his
  bowels even&#8212;for that is the seat of sympathy&#8212;he forthwith sets about
  reforming&#8212;the world. Being a microcosm himself, he discovers&#8212;and it is a
  true discovery, and he is the man to make it&#8212;that the world has been eating green
  apples; to his eyes, in fact, the globe itself is a great green apple, which there is
  danger awful to think of that the children of men will nibble before it is ripe; and
  straightway his drastic philanthropy seeks out the Esquimau and the Patagonian, and
  embraces the populous Indian and Chinese villages; and thus, by a few years of
  philanthropic activity, the powers in the meanwhile using him for their own ends, no
  doubt, he cures himself of his dyspepsia, the globe acquires a faint blush on one or
  both of its cheeks, as if it were beginning to be ripe, and life loses its crudity and
  is once more sweet and wholesome to live. I never dreamed of any enormity greater than
  I have committed. I never knew, and never shall know, a worse man than myself.</p>

  <p>I believe that what so saddens the reformer is not his sympathy with his fellows in
  distress, but, though he be the holiest son of God, is his private ail. Let this be
  righted, let the spring come to him, the morning rise over his couch, and he will
  forsake his generous companions without apology. My excuse for not lecturing against
  the use of tobacco is, that I never chewed it, that is a penalty which reformed
  tobacco-chewers have to pay; though there are things enough I have chewed which I could
  lecture against. If you should ever be betrayed into any of these philanthropies, do
  not let your left hand know what your right hand does, for it is not worth knowing.
  Rescue the drowning and tie your shoestrings. Take your time, and set about some free
  labor.</p>

  <p>Our manners have been corrupted by communication with the saints. Our hymn-books
  resound with a melodious cursing of God and enduring Him forever. One would say that
  even the prophets and redeemers had rather consoled the fears than confirmed the hopes
  of man. There is nowhere recorded a simple and irrepressible satisfaction with the gift
  of life, any memorable praise of God. All health and success does me good, however far
  off and withdrawn it may appear; all disease and failure helps to make me sad and does
  me evil, however much sympathy it may have with me or I with it. If, then, we would
  indeed restore mankind by truly Indian, botanic, magnetic, or natural means, let us
  first be as simple and well as Nature ourselves, dispel the clouds which hang over our
  own brows, and take up a little life into our pores. Do not stay to be an overseer of
  the poor, but endeavor to become one of the worthies of the world.</p>

  <p>I read in the Gulistan, or Flower Garden, of Sheik Sadi of Shiraz, that "they asked
  a wise man, saying: Of the many celebrated trees which the Most High God has created
  lofty and umbrageous, they call none azad, or free, excepting the cypress, which bears
  no fruit; what mystery is there in this? He replied, Each has its appropriate produce,
  and appointed season, during the continuance of which it is fresh and blooming, and
  during their absence dry and withered; to neither of which states is the cypress
  exposed, being always flourishing; and of this nature are the azads, or religious
  independents.&#8212;Fix not thy heart on that which is transitory; for the Dijlah, or
  Tigris, will continue to flow through Bagdad after the race of caliphs is extinct: if
  thy hand has plenty, be liberal as the date tree; but if it affords nothing to give
  away, be an azad, or free man, like the cypress."</p>

          Thou dost presume too much, poor needy wretch,
          To claim a station in the firmament

  <h2>Where I Lived, and What I Lived For</h2>

  <p>At a certain season of our life we are accustomed to consider every spot as the
  possible site of a house. I have thus surveyed the country on every side within a dozen
  miles of where I live. In imagination I have bought all the farms in succession, for
  all were to be bought, and I knew their price. I walked over each farmer's premises,
  tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price,
  at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher price on it&#8212;took
  everything but a deed of it&#8212;took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to
  talk&#8212;cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had
  enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on. This experience entitled me to be
  regarded as a sort of real-estate broker by my friends. Wherever I sat, there I might
  live, and the landscape radiated from me accordingly. What is a house but a
  <i>sedes</i>, a seat?&#8212;better if a country seat. I discovered many a site for a
  house not likely to be soon improved, which some might have thought too far from the
  village, but to my eyes the village was too far from it. Well, there I might live, I
  said; and there I did live, for an hour, a summer and a winter life; saw how I could
  let the years run off, buffet the winter through, and see the spring come in. The
  future inhabitants of this region, wherever they may place their houses, may be sure
  that they have been anticipated. An afternoon sufficed to lay out the land into
  orchard, wood-lot, and pasture, and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to
  stand before the door, and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best
  advantage; and then I let it lie, fallow, perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to
  the number of things which he can afford to let alone.</p>

  <p>My imagination carried me so far that I even had the refusal of several
  farms&#8212;the refusal was all I wanted&#8212;but I never got my fingers burned by
  actual possession. The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the
  Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and collected materials with which to
  make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of
  it, his wife&#8212;every man has such a wife&#8212;changed her mind and wished to keep
  it, and he offered me ten dollars to release him. Now, to speak the truth, I had but
  ten cents in the world, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was that man who
  had ten cents, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or all together. However, I let him
  keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or rather, to
  be generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich
  man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds, and
  materials for a wheelbarrow left. I found thus that I had been a rich man without any
  damage to my poverty. But I retained the landscape, and I have since annually carried
  off what it yielded without a wheelbarrow. With respect to landscapes,</p>
  <pre>               "I am monarch of all I <i>survey</i>,
                My right there is none to dispute."
</pre>

  <p class="nind">I have frequently seen a poet withdraw, having enjoyed the most
  valuable part of a farm, while the crusty farmer supposed that he had got a few wild
  apples only. Why, the owner does not know it for many years when a poet has put his
  farm in rhyme, the most admirable kind of invisible fence, has fairly impounded it,
  milked it, skimmed it, and got all the cream, and left the farmer only the skimmed
  milk.</p>

  <p>The real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to me, were: its complete retirement,
  being, about two miles from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, and
  separated from the highway by a broad field; its bounding on the river, which the owner
  said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the spring, though that was nothing to me;
  the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated fences,
  which put such an interval between me and the last occupant; the hollow and
  lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should
  have; but above all, the recollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up the
  river, when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I
  heard the house-dog bark. I was in haste to buy it, before the proprietor finished
  getting out some rocks, cutting down the hollow apple trees, and grubbing up some young
  birches which had sprung up in the pasture, or, in short, had made any more of his
  improvements. To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take
  the world on my shoulders&#8212;I never heard what compensation he received for
  that&#8212;and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might
  pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it
  would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let
  it alone. But it turned out as I have said.</p>

  <p>All that I could say, then, with respect to farming on a large scale&#8212;I have
  always cultivated a garden&#8212;was, that I had had my seeds ready. Many think that
  seeds improve with age. I have no doubt that time discriminates between the good and
  the bad; and when at last I shall plant, I shall be less likely to be disappointed. But
  I would say to my fellows, once for all, As long as possible live free and uncommitted.
  It makes but little difference whether you are committed to a farm or the county
  jail.</p>

  <p>Old Cato, whose "De Re Rustic&#226;" is my "Cultivator," says&#8212;and the only
  translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage&#8212;"When you think of
  getting a farm turn it thus in your mind, not to buy greedily; nor spare your pains to
  look at it, and do not think it enough to go round it once. The oftener you go there
  the more it will please you, if it is good." I think I shall not buy greedily, but go
  round and round it as long as I live, and be buried in it first, that it may please me
  the more at last.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>The present was my next experiment of this kind, which I purpose to describe more at
  length, for convenience putting the experience of two years into one. As I have said, I
  do not propose to write an ode to dejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in
  the morning, standing on his roost, if only to wake my neighbors up.</p>

  <p>When first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights as
  well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July,
  1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against the rain,
  without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with
  wide chinks, which made it cool at night. The upright white hewn studs and freshly
  planed door and window casings gave it a clean and airy look, especially in the
  morning, when its timbers were saturated with dew, so that I fancied that by noon some
  sweet gum would exude from them. To my imagination it retained throughout the day more
  or less of this auroral character, reminding me of a certain house on a mountain which
  I had visited a year before. This was an airy and unplastered cabin, fit to entertain a
  travelling god, and where a goddess might trail her garments. The winds which passed
  over my dwelling were such as sweep over the ridges of mountains, bearing the broken
  strains, or celestial parts only, of terrestrial music. The morning wind forever blows,
  the poem of creation is uninterrupted; but few are the ears that hear it. Olympus is
  but the outside of the earth everywhere.</p>

  <p>The only house I had been the owner of before, if I except a boat, was a tent, which
  I used occasionally when making excursions in the summer, and this is still rolled up
  in my garret; but the boat, after passing from hand to hand, has gone down the stream
  of time. With this more substantial shelter about me, I had made some progress toward
  settling in the world. This frame, so slightly clad, was a sort of crystallization
  around me, and reacted on the builder. It was suggestive somewhat as a picture in
  outlines. I did not need to go outdoors to take the air, for the atmosphere within had
  lost none of its freshness. It was not so much within doors as behind a door where I
  sat, even in the rainiest weather. The Harivansa says, "An abode without birds is like
  a meat without seasoning." Such was not my abode, for I found myself suddenly neighbor
  to the birds; not by having imprisoned one, but having caged myself near them. I was
  not only nearer to some of those which commonly frequent the garden and the orchard,
  but to those smaller and more thrilling songsters of the forest which never, or rarely,
  serenade a villager&#8212;the wood thrush, the veery, the scarlet tanager, the field
  sparrow, the whip-poor-will, and many others.</p>

  <p>I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the
  village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive wood
  between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known
  to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore,
  half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant horizon. For the
  first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on
  the side of a mountain, its bottom far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the
  sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by
  degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the
  mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as
  at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle. The very dew seemed to hang upon the
  trees later into the day than usual, as on the sides of mountains.</p>

  <p>This small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle
  rain-storm in August, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but the sky
  overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of evening, and the wood thrush sang
  around, and was heard from shore to shore. A lake like this is never smoother than at
  such a time; and the clear portion of the air above it being, shallow and darkened by
  clouds, the water, full of light and reflections, becomes a lower heaven itself so much
  the more important. From a hill-top near by, where the wood had been recently cut off,
  there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond, through a wide indentation in the
  hills which form the shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other
  suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but stream
  there was none. That way I looked between and over the near green hills to some distant
  and higher ones in the horizon, tinged with blue. Indeed, by standing on tiptoe I could
  catch a glimpse of some of the peaks of the still bluer and more distant mountain
  ranges in the northwest, those true-blue coins from heaven's own mint, and also of some
  portion of the village. But in other directions, even from this point, I could not see
  over or beyond the woods which surrounded me. It is well to have some water in your
  neighborhood, to give buoyancy to and float the earth. One value even of the smallest
  well is, that when you look into it you see that earth is not continent but insular.
  This is as important as that it keeps butter cool. When I looked across the pond from
  this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood I distinguished elevated
  perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley, like a coin in a basin, all the earth
  beyond the pond appeared like a thin crust insulated and floated even by this small
  sheet of interverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but
  <i>dry land</i>.</p>

  <p>Though the view from my door was still more contracted, I did not feel crowded or
  confined in the least. There was pasture enough for my imagination. The low shrub oak
  plateau to which the opposite shore arose stretched away toward the prairies of the
  West and the steppes of Tartary, affording ample room for all the roving families of
  men. "There are none happy in the world but beings who enjoy freely a vast
  horizon"&#8212;said Damodara, when his herds required new and larger pastures.</p>

  <p>Both place and time were changed, and I dwelt nearer to those parts of the universe
  and to those eras in history which had most attracted me. Where I lived was as far off
  as many a region viewed nightly by astronomers. We are wont to imagine rare and
  delectable places in some remote and more celestial corner of the system, behind the
  constellation of Cassiopeia's Chair, far from noise and disturbance. I discovered that
  my house actually had its site in such a withdrawn, but forever new and unprofaned,
  part of the universe. If it were worth the while to settle in those parts near to the
  Pleiades or the Hyades, to Aldebaran or Altair, then I was really there, or at an equal
  remoteness from the life which I had left behind, dwindled and twinkling with as fine a
  ray to my nearest neighbor, and to be seen only in moonless nights by him. Such was
  that part of creation where I had squatted;</p>
  <pre>              "There was a shepherd that did live,
                  And held his thoughts as high
               As were the mounts whereon his flocks
                  Did hourly feed him by."
</pre>

  <p class="nind">What should we think of the shepherd's life if his flocks always
  wandered to higher pastures than his thoughts?</p>

  <p>Every morning was a cheerful invitation to make my life of equal simplicity, and I
  may say innocence, with Nature herself. I have been as sincere a worshipper of Aurora
  as the Greeks. I got up early and bathed in the pond; that was a religious exercise,
  and one of the best things which I did. They say that characters were engraven on the
  bathing tub of King Tchingthang to this effect: "Renew thyself completely each day; do
  it again, and again, and forever again." I can understand that. Morning brings back the
  heroic ages. I was as much affected by the faint hum of a mosquito making its invisible
  and unimaginable tour through my apartment at earliest dawn, when I was sitting with
  door and windows open, as I could be by any trumpet that ever sang of fame. It was
  Homer's requiem; itself an Iliad and Odyssey in the air, singing its own wrath and
  wanderings. There was something cosmical about it; a standing advertisement, till
  forbidden, of the everlasting vigor and fertility of the world. The morning, which is
  the most memorable season of the day, is the awakening hour. Then there is least
  somnolence in us; and for an hour, at least, some part of us awakes which slumbers all
  the rest of the day and night. Little is to be expected of that day, if it can be
  called a day, to which we are not awakened by our Genius, but by the mechanical
  nudgings of some servitor, are not awakened by our own newly acquired force and
  aspirations from within, accompanied by the undulations of celestial music, instead of
  factory bells, and a fragrance filling the air&#8212;to a higher life than we fell
  asleep from; and thus the darkness bear its fruit, and prove itself to be good, no less
  than the light. That man who does not believe that each day contains an earlier, more
  sacred, and auroral hour than he has yet profaned, has despaired of life, and is
  pursuing a descending and darkening way. After a partial cessation of his sensuous
  life, the soul of man, or its organs rather, are reinvigorated each day, and his Genius
  tries again what noble life it can make. All memorable events, I should say, transpire
  in morning time and in a morning atmosphere. The Vedas say, "All intelligences awake
  with the morning." Poetry and art, and the fairest and most memorable of the actions of
  men, date from such an hour. All poets and heroes, like Memnon, are the children of
  Aurora, and emit their music at sunrise. To him whose elastic and vigorous thought
  keeps pace with the sun, the day is a perpetual morning. It matters not what the clocks
  say or the attitudes and labors of men. Morning is when I am awake and there is a dawn
  in me. Moral reform is the effort to throw off sleep. Why is it that men give so poor
  an account of their day if they have not been slumbering? They are not such poor
  calculators. If they had not been overcome with drowsiness, they would have performed
  something. The millions are awake enough for physical labor; but only one in a million
  is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to
  a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be alive. I have never yet met a man who was
  quite awake. How could I have looked him in the face?</p>

  <p>We must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical aids, but by
  an infinite expectation of the dawn, which does not forsake us in our soundest sleep. I
  know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his
  life by a conscious endeavor. It is something to be able to paint a particular picture,
  or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful; but it is far more
  glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which
  morally we can do. To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts. Every
  man is tasked to make his life, even in its details, worthy of the contemplation of his
  most elevated and critical hour. If we refused, or rather used up, such paltry
  information as we get, the oracles would distinctly inform us how this might be
  done.</p>

  <p>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the
  essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not,
  when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not
  life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite
  necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so
  sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath
  and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and,
  if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and
  publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and
  be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion. For most men, it appears to
  me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and
  have <i>somewhat hastily</i> concluded that it is the chief end of man here to "glorify
  God and enjoy him forever."</p>

  <p>Still we live meanly, like ants; though the fable tells us that we were long ago
  changed into men; like pygmies we fight with cranes; it is error upon error, and clout
  upon clout, and our best virtue has for its occasion a superfluous and evitable
  wretchedness. Our life is frittered away by detail. An honest man has hardly need to
  count more than his ten fingers, or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes, and lump
  the rest. Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or
  three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and
  keep your accounts on your thumb-nail. In the midst of this chopping sea of civilized
  life, such are the clouds and storms and quicksands and thousand-and-one items to be
  allowed for, that a man has to live, if he would not founder and go to the bottom and
  not make his port at all, by dead reckoning, and he must be a great calculator indeed
  who succeeds. Simplify, simplify. Instead of three meals a day, if it be necessary eat
  but one; instead of a hundred dishes, five; and reduce other things in proportion. Our
  life is like a German Confederacy, made up of petty states, with its boundary forever
  fluctuating, so that even a German cannot tell you how it is bounded at any moment. The
  nation itself, with all its so-called internal improvements, which, by the way are all
  external and superficial, is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment,
  cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps, ruined by luxury and heedless
  expense, by want of calculation and a worthy aim, as the million households in the
  land; and the only cure for it, as for them, is in a rigid economy, a stern and more
  than Spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose. It lives too fast. Men think
  that it is essential that the <i>Nation</i> have commerce, and export ice, and talk
  through a telegraph, and ride thirty miles an hour, without a doubt, whether
  <i>they</i> do or not; but whether we should live like baboons or like men, is a little
  uncertain. If we do not get out sleepers, and forge rails, and devote days and nights
  to the work, but go to tinkering upon our <i>lives</i> to improve <i>them</i>, who will
  build railroads? And if railroads are not built, how shall we get to heaven in season?
  But if we stay at home and mind our business, who will want railroads? We do not ride
  on the railroad; it rides upon us. Did you ever think what those sleepers are that
  underlie the railroad? Each one is a man, an Irishman, or a Yankee man. The rails are
  laid on them, and they are covered with sand, and the cars run smoothly over them. They
  are sound sleepers, I assure you. And every few years a new lot is laid down and run
  over; so that, if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail, others have the
  misfortune to be ridden upon. And when they run over a man that is walking in his
  sleep, a supernumerary sleeper in the wrong position, and wake him up, they suddenly
  stop the cars, and make a hue and cry about it, as if this were an exception. I am glad
  to know that it takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and
  level in their beds as it is, for this is a sign that they may sometime get up
  again.</p>

  <p>Why should we live with such hurry and waste of life? We are determined to be
  starved before we are hungry. Men say that a stitch in time saves nine, and so they
  take a thousand stitches today to save nine tomorrow. As for <i>work</i>, we haven't
  any of any consequence. We have the Saint Vitus' dance, and cannot possibly keep our
  heads still. If I should only give a few pulls at the parish bell-rope, as for a fire,
  that is, without setting the bell, there is hardly a man on his farm in the outskirts
  of Concord, notwithstanding that press of engagements which was his excuse so many
  times this morning, nor a boy, nor a woman, I might almost say, but would forsake all
  and follow that sound, not mainly to save property from the flames, but, if we will
  confess the truth, much more to see it burn, since burn it must, and we, be it known,
  did not set it on fire&#8212;or to see it put out, and have a hand in it, if that is
  done as handsomely; yes, even if it were the parish church itself. Hardly a man takes a
  half-hour's nap after dinner, but when he wakes he holds up his head and asks, "What's
  the news?" as if the rest of mankind had stood his sentinels. Some give directions to
  be waked every half-hour, doubtless for no other purpose; and then, to pay for it, they
  tell what they have dreamed. After a night's sleep the news is as indispensable as the
  breakfast. "Pray tell me anything new that has happened to a man anywhere on this
  globe"&#8212;and he reads it over his coffee and rolls, that a man has had his eyes
  gouged out this morning on the Wachito River; never dreaming the while that he lives in
  the dark unfathomed mammoth cave of this world, and has but the rudiment of an eye
  himself.</p>

  <p>For my part, I could easily do without the post-office. I think that there are very
  few important communications made through it. To speak critically, I never received
  more than one or two letters in my life&#8212;I wrote this some years ago&#8212;that
  were worth the postage. The penny-post is, commonly, an institution through which you
  seriously offer a man that penny for his thoughts which is so often safely offered in
  jest. And I am sure that I never read any memorable news in a newspaper. If we read of
  one man robbed, or murdered, or killed by accident, or one house burned, or one vessel
  wrecked, or one steamboat blown up, or one cow run over on the Western Railroad, or one
  mad dog killed, or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter&#8212;we never need read of
  another. One is enough. If you are acquainted with the principle, what do you care for
  a myriad instances and applications? To a philosopher all <i>news</i>, as it is called,
  is gossip, and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea. Yet not a few
  are greedy after this gossip. There was such a rush, as I hear, the other day at one of
  the offices to learn the foreign news by the last arrival, that several large squares
  of plate glass belonging to the establishment were broken by the pressure&#8212;news
  which I seriously think a ready wit might write a twelve-month, or twelve years,
  beforehand with sufficient accuracy. As for Spain, for instance, if you know how to
  throw in Don Carlos and the Infanta, and Don Pedro and Seville and Granada, from time
  to time in the right proportions&#8212;they may have changed the names a little since I
  saw the papers&#8212;and serve up a bull-fight when other entertainments fail, it will
  be true to the letter, and give us as good an idea of the exact state or ruin of things
  in Spain as the most succinct and lucid reports under this head in the newspapers: and
  as for England, almost the last significant scrap of news from that quarter was the
  revolution of 1649; and if you have learned the history of her crops for an average
  year, you never need attend to that thing again, unless your speculations are of a
  merely pecuniary character. If one may judge who rarely looks into the newspapers,
  nothing new does ever happen in foreign parts, a French revolution not excepted.</p>

  <p>What news! how much more important to know what that is which was never old!
  "Kieou-he-yu (great dignitary of the state of Wei) sent a man to Khoung-tseu to know
  his news. Khoung-tseu caused the messenger to be seated near him, and questioned him in
  these terms: What is your master doing? The messenger answered with respect: My master
  desires to diminish the number of his faults, but he cannot come to the end of them.
  The messenger being gone, the philosopher remarked: What a worthy messenger! What a
  worthy messenger!" The preacher, instead of vexing the ears of drowsy farmers on their
  day of rest at the end of the week&#8212;for Sunday is the fit conclusion of an
  ill-spent week, and not the fresh and brave beginning of a new one&#8212;with this one
  other draggle-tail of a sermon, should shout with thundering voice, "Pause! Avast! Why
  so seeming fast, but deadly slow?"</p>

  <p>Shams and delusions are esteemed for soundest truths, while reality is fabulous. If
  men would steadily observe realities only, and not allow themselves to be deluded,
  life, to compare it with such things as we know, would be like a fairy tale and the
  Arabian Nights' Entertainments. If we respected only what is inevitable and has a right
  to be, music and poetry would resound along the streets. When we are unhurried and
  wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute
  existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality. This
  is always exhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and slumbering, and consenting
  to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and
  habit everywhere, which still is built on purely illusory foundations. Children, who
  play life, discern its true law and relations more clearly than men, who fail to live
  it worthily, but who think that they are wiser by experience, that is, by failure. I
  have read in a Hindoo book, that "there was a king's son, who, being expelled in
  infancy from his native city, was brought up by a forester, and, growing up to maturity
  in that state, imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he lived.
  One of his father's ministers having discovered him, revealed to him what he was, and
  the misconception of his character was removed, and he knew himself to be a prince. So
  soul," continues the Hindoo philosopher, "from the circumstances in which it is placed,
  mistakes its own character, until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher, and
  then it knows itself to be Brahme." I perceive that we inhabitants of New England live
  this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate the surface of things.
  We think that that <i>is</i> which <i>appears</i> to be. If a man should walk through
  this town and see only the reality, where, think you, would the "Mill-dam" go to? If he
  should give us an account of the realities he beheld there, we should not recognize the
  place in his description. Look at a meeting-house, or a court-house, or a jail, or a
  shop, or a dwelling-house, and say what that thing really is before a true gaze, and
  they would all go to pieces in your account of them. Men esteem truth remote, in the
  outskirts of the system, behind the farthest star, before Adam and after the last man.
  In eternity there is indeed something true and sublime. But all these times and places
  and occasions are now and here. God himself culminates in the present moment, and will
  never be more divine in the lapse of all the ages. And we are enabled to apprehend at
  all what is sublime and noble only by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the
  reality that surrounds us. The universe constantly and obediently answers to our
  conceptions; whether we travel fast or slow, the track is laid for us. Let us spend our
  lives in conceiving then. The poet or the artist never yet had so fair and noble a
  design but some of his posterity at least could accomplish it.</p>

  <p>Let us spend one day as deliberately as Nature, and not be thrown off the track by
  every nutshell and mosquito's wing that falls on the rails. Let us rise early and fast,
  or break fast, gently and without perturbation; let company come and let company go,
  let the bells ring and the children cry&#8212;determined to make a day of it. Why
  should we knock under and go with the stream? Let us not be upset and overwhelmed in
  that terrible rapid and whirlpool called a dinner, situated in the meridian shallows.
  Weather this danger and you are safe, for the rest of the way is down hill. With
  unrelaxed nerves, with morning vigor, sail by it, looking another way, tied to the mast
  like Ulysses. If the engine whistles, let it whistle till it is hoarse for its pains.
  If the bell rings, why should we run? We will consider what kind of music they are
  like. Let us settle ourselves, and work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and
  slush of opinion, and prejudice, and tradition, and delusion, and appearance, that
  alluvion which covers the globe, through Paris and London, through New York and Boston
  and Concord, through Church and State, through poetry and philosophy and religion, till
  we come to a hard bottom and rocks in place, which we can call <i>reality</i>, and say,
  This is, and no mistake; and then begin, having a <i>point d'appui</i>, below freshet
  and frost and fire, a place where you might found a wall or a state, or set a lamp-post
  safely, or perhaps a gauge, not a Nilometer, but a Realometer, that future ages might
  know how deep a freshet of shams and appearances had gathered from time to time. If you
  stand right fronting and face to face to a fact, you will see the sun glimmer on both
  its surfaces, as if it were a cimeter, and feel its sweet edge dividing you through the
  heart and marrow, and so you will happily conclude your mortal career. Be it life or
  death, we crave only reality. If we are really dying, let us hear the rattle in our
  throats and feel cold in the extremities; if we are alive, let us go about our
  business.</p>

  <p>Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in. I drink at it; but while I drink I see the
  sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is. Its thin current slides away, but eternity
  remains. I would drink deeper; fish in the sky, whose bottom is pebbly with stars. I
  cannot count one. I know not the first letter of the alphabet. I have always been
  regretting that I was not as wise as the day I was born. The intellect is a cleaver; it
  discerns and rifts its way into the secret of things. I do not wish to be any more busy
  with my hands than is necessary. My head is hands and feet. I feel all my best
  faculties concentrated in it. My instinct tells me that my head is an organ for
  burrowing, as some creatures use their snout and fore paws, and with it I would mine
  and burrow my way through these hills. I think that the richest vein is somewhere
  hereabouts; so by the divining-rod and thin rising vapors I judge; and here I will
  begin to mine.</p>

  <h2>Reading</h2>

  <p>With a little more deliberation in the choice of their pursuits, all men would
  perhaps become essentially students and observers, for certainly their nature and
  destiny are interesting to all alike. In accumulating property for ourselves or our
  posterity, in founding a family or a state, or acquiring fame even, we are mortal; but
  in dealing with truth we are immortal, and need fear no change nor accident. The oldest
  Egyptian or Hindoo philosopher raised a corner of the veil from the statue of the
  divinity; and still the trembling robe remains raised, and I gaze upon as fresh a glory
  as he did, since it was I in him that was then so bold, and it is he in me that now
  reviews the vision. No dust has settled on that robe; no time has elapsed since that
  divinity was revealed. That time which we really improve, or which is improvable, is
  neither past, present, nor future.</p>

  <p>My residence was more favorable, not only to thought, but to serious reading, than a
  university; and though I was beyond the range of the ordinary circulating library, I
  had more than ever come within the influence of those books which circulate round the
  world, whose sentences were first written on bark, and are now merely copied from time
  to time on to linen paper. Says the poet M&#238;r Camar Udd&#238;n Mast, "Being
  seated, to run through the region of the spiritual world; I have had this advantage in
  books. To be intoxicated by a single glass of wine; I have experienced this pleasure
  when I have drunk the liquor of the esoteric doctrines." I kept Homer's Iliad on my
  table through the summer, though I looked at his page only now and then. Incessant
  labor with my hands, at first, for I had my house to finish and my beans to hoe at the
  same time, made more study impossible. Yet I sustained myself by the prospect of such
  reading in future. I read one or two shallow books of travel in the intervals of my
  work, till that employment made me ashamed of myself, and I asked where it was then
  that <i>I</i> lived.</p>

  <p>The student may read Homer or &#198;schylus in the Greek without danger of
  dissipation or luxuriousness, for it implies that he in some measure emulate their
  heroes, and consecrate morning hours to their pages. The heroic books, even if printed
  in the character of our mother tongue, will always be in a language dead to degenerate
  times; and we must laboriously seek the meaning of each word and line, conjecturing a
  larger sense than common use permits out of what wisdom and valor and generosity we
  have. The modern cheap and fertile press, with all its translations, has done little to
  bring us nearer to the heroic writers of antiquity. They seem as solitary, and the
  letter in which they are printed as rare and curious, as ever. It is worth the expense
  of youthful days and costly hours, if you learn only some words of an ancient language,
  which are raised out of the trivialness of the street, to be perpetual suggestions and
  provocations. It is not in vain that the farmer remembers and repeats the few Latin
  words which he has heard. Men sometimes speak as if the study of the classics would at
  length make way for more modern and practical studies; but the adventurous student will
  always study classics, in whatever language they may be written and however ancient
  they may be. For what are the classics but the noblest recorded thoughts of man? They
  are the only oracles which are not decayed, and there are such answers to the most
  modern inquiry in them as Delphi and Dodona never gave. We might as well omit to study
  Nature because she is old. To read well, that is, to read true books in a true spirit,
  is a noble exercise, and one that will task the reader more than any exercise which the
  customs of the day esteem. It requires a training such as the athletes underwent, the
  steady intention almost of the whole life to this object. Books must be read as
  deliberately and reservedly as they were written. It is not enough even to be able to
  speak the language of that nation by which they are written, for there is a memorable
  interval between the spoken and the written language, the language heard and the
  language read. The one is commonly transitory, a sound, a tongue, a dialect merely,
  almost brutish, and we learn it unconsciously, like the brutes, of our mothers. The
  other is the maturity and experience of that; if that is our mother tongue, this is our
  father tongue, a reserved and select expression, too significant to be heard by the
  ear, which we must be born again in order to speak. The crowds of men who merely spoke
  the Greek and Latin tongues in the Middle Ages were not entitled by the accident of
  birth to read the works of genius written in those languages; for these were not
  written in that Greek or Latin which they knew, but in the select language of
  literature. They had not learned the nobler dialects of Greece and Rome, but the very
  materials on which they were written were waste paper to them, and they prized instead
  a cheap contemporary literature. But when the several nations of Europe had acquired
  distinct though rude written languages of their own, sufficient for the purposes of
  their rising literatures, then first learning revived, and scholars were enabled to
  discern from that remoteness the treasures of antiquity. What the Roman and Grecian
  multitude could not <i>hear</i>, after the lapse of ages a few scholars <i>read</i>,
  and a few scholars only are still reading it.</p>

  <p>However much we may admire the orator's occasional bursts of eloquence, the noblest
  written words are commonly as far behind or above the fleeting spoken language as the
  firmament with its stars is behind the clouds. <i>There</i> are the stars, and they who
  can may read them. The astronomers forever comment on and observe them. They are not
  exhalations like our daily colloquies and vaporous breath. What is called eloquence in
  the forum is commonly found to be rhetoric in the study. The orator yields to the
  inspiration of a transient occasion, and speaks to the mob before him, to those who can
  <i>hear</i> him; but the writer, whose more equable life is his occasion, and who would
  be distracted by the event and the crowd which inspire the orator, speaks to the
  intellect and health of mankind, to all in any age who can <i>understand</i> him.</p>

  <p>No wonder that Alexander carried the Iliad with him on his expeditions in a precious
  casket. A written word is the choicest of relics. It is something at once more intimate
  with us and more universal than any other work of art. It is the work of art nearest to
  life itself. It may be translated into every language, and not only be read but
  actually breathed from all human lips;&#8212;not be represented on canvas or in marble
  only, but be carved out of the breath of life itself. The symbol of an ancient man's
  thought becomes a modern man's speech. Two thousand summers have imparted to the
  monuments of Grecian literature, as to her marbles, only a maturer golden and autumnal
  tint, for they have carried their own serene and celestial atmosphere into all lands to
  protect them against the corrosion of time. Books are the treasured wealth of the world
  and the fit inheritance of generations and nations. Books, the oldest and the best,
  stand naturally and rightfully on the shelves of every cottage. They have no cause of
  their own to plead, but while they enlighten and sustain the reader his common sense
  will not refuse them. Their authors are a natural and irresistible aristocracy in every
  society, and, more than kings or emperors, exert an influence on mankind. When the
  illiterate and perhaps scornful trader has earned by enterprise and industry his
  coveted leisure and independence, and is admitted to the circles of wealth and fashion,
  he turns inevitably at last to those still higher but yet inaccessible circles of
  intellect and genius, and is sensible only of the imperfection of his culture and the
  vanity and insufficiency of all his riches, and further proves his good sense by the
  pains which he takes to secure for his children that intellectual culture whose want he
  so keenly feels; and thus it is that he becomes the founder of a family.</p>

  <p>Those who have not learned to read the ancient classics in the language in which
  they were written must have a very imperfect knowledge of the history of the human
  race; for it is remarkable that no transcript of them has ever been made into any
  modern tongue, unless our civilization itself may be regarded as such a transcript.
  Homer has never yet been printed in English, nor &#198;schylus, nor Virgil
  even&#8212;works as refined, as solidly done, and as beautiful almost as the morning
  itself; for later writers, say what we will of their genius, have rarely, if ever,
  equalled the elaborate beauty and finish and the lifelong and heroic literary labors of
  the ancients. They only talk of forgetting them who never knew them. It will be soon
  enough to forget them when we have the learning and the genius which will enable us to
  attend to and appreciate them. That age will be rich indeed when those relics which we
  call Classics, and the still older and more than classic but even less known Scriptures
  of the nations, shall have still further accumulated, when the Vaticans shall be filled
  with Vedas and Zendavestas and Bibles, with Homers and Dantes and Shakespeares, and all
  the centuries to come shall have successively deposited their trophies in the forum of
  the world. By such a pile we may hope to scale heaven at last.</p>

  <p>The works of the great poets have never yet been read by mankind, for only great
  poets can read them. They have only been read as the multitude read the stars, at most
  astrologically, not astronomically. Most men have learned to read to serve a paltry
  convenience, as they have learned to cipher in order to keep accounts and not be
  cheated in trade; but of reading as a noble intellectual exercise they know little or
  nothing; yet this only is reading, in a high sense, not that which lulls us as a luxury
  and suffers the nobler faculties to sleep the while, but what we have to stand on
  tip-toe to read and devote our most alert and wakeful hours to.</p>

  <p>I think that having learned our letters we should read the best that is in
  literature, and not be forever repeating our a-b-abs, and words of one syllable, in the
  fourth or fifth classes, sitting on the lowest and foremost form all our lives. Most
  men are satisfied if they read or hear read, and perchance have been convicted by the
  wisdom of one good book, the Bible, and for the rest of their lives vegetate and
  dissipate their faculties in what is called easy reading. There is a work in several
  volumes in our Circulating Library entitled "Little Reading," which I thought referred
  to a town of that name which I had not been to. There are those who, like cormorants
  and ostriches, can digest all sorts of this, even after the fullest dinner of meats and
  vegetables, for they suffer nothing to be wasted. If others are the machines to provide
  this provender, they are the machines to read it. They read the nine thousandth tale
  about Zebulon and Sophronia, and how they loved as none had ever loved before, and
  neither did the course of their true love run smooth&#8212;at any rate, how it did run
  and stumble, and get up again and go on! how some poor unfortunate got up on to a
  steeple, who had better never have gone up as far as the belfry; and then, having
  needlessly got him up there, the happy novelist rings the bell for all the world to
  come together and hear, O dear! how he did get down again! For my part, I think that
  they had better metamorphose all such aspiring heroes of universal noveldom into man
  weather-cocks, as they used to put heroes among the constellations, and let them swing
  round there till they are rusty, and not come down at all to bother honest men with
  their pranks. The next time the novelist rings the bell I will not stir though the
  meeting-house burn down. "The Skip of the Tip-Toe-Hop, a Romance of the Middle Ages, by
  the celebrated author of 'Tittle-Tol-Tan,' to appear in monthly parts; a great rush;
  don't all come together." All this they read with saucer eyes, and erect and primitive
  curiosity, and with unwearied gizzard, whose corrugations even yet need no sharpening,
  just as some little four-year-old bencher his two-cent gilt-covered edition of
  Cinderella&#8212;without any improvement, that I can see, in the pronunciation, or
  accent, or emphasis, or any more skill in extracting or inserting the moral. The result
  is dulness of sight, a stagnation of the vital circulations, and a general deliquium
  and sloughing off of all the intellectual faculties. This sort of gingerbread is baked
  daily and more sedulously than pure wheat or rye-and-Indian in almost every oven, and
  finds a surer market.</p>

  <p>The best books are not read even by those who are called good readers. What does our
  Concord culture amount to? There is in this town, with a very few exceptions, no taste
  for the best or for very good books even in English literature, whose words all can
  read and spell. Even the college-bred and so-called liberally educated men here and
  elsewhere have really little or no acquaintance with the English classics; and as for
  the recorded wisdom of mankind, the ancient classics and Bibles, which are accessible
  to all who will know of them, there are the feeblest efforts anywhere made to become
  acquainted with them. I know a woodchopper, of middle age, who takes a French paper,
  not for news as he says, for he is above that, but to "keep himself in practice," he
  being a Canadian by birth; and when I ask him what he considers the best thing he can
  do in this world, he says, beside this, to keep up and add to his English. This is
  about as much as the college-bred generally do or aspire to do, and they take an
  English paper for the purpose. One who has just come from reading perhaps one of the
  best English books will find how many with whom he can converse about it? Or suppose he
  comes from reading a Greek or Latin classic in the original, whose praises are familiar
  even to the so-called illiterate; he will find nobody at all to speak to, but must keep
  silence about it. Indeed, there is hardly the professor in our colleges, who, if he has
  mastered the difficulties of the language, has proportionally mastered the difficulties
  of the wit and poetry of a Greek poet, and has any sympathy to impart to the alert and
  heroic reader; and as for the sacred Scriptures, or Bibles of mankind, who in this town
  can tell me even their titles? Most men do not know that any nation but the Hebrews
  have had a scripture. A man, any man, will go considerably out of his way to pick up a
  silver dollar; but here are golden words, which the wisest men of antiquity have
  uttered, and whose worth the wise of every succeeding age have assured us of;&#8212;and
  yet we learn to read only as far as Easy Reading, the primers and class-books, and when
  we leave school, the "Little Reading," and story-books, which are for boys and
  beginners; and our reading, our conversation and thinking, are all on a very low level,
  worthy only of pygmies and manikins.</p>

  <p>I aspire to be acquainted with wiser men than this our Concord soil has produced,
  whose names are hardly known here. Or shall I hear the name of Plato and never read his
  book? As if Plato were my townsman and I never saw him&#8212;my next neighbor and I
  never heard him speak or attended to the wisdom of his words. But how actually is it?
  His Dialogues, which contain what was immortal in him, lie on the next shelf, and yet I
  never read them. We are underbred and low-lived and illiterate; and in this respect I
  confess I do not make any very broad distinction between the illiterateness of my
  townsman who cannot read at all and the illiterateness of him who has learned to read
  only what is for children and feeble intellects. We should be as good as the worthies
  of antiquity, but partly by first knowing how good they were. We are a race of tit-men,
  and soar but little higher in our intellectual flights than the columns of the daily
  paper.</p>

  <p>It is not all books that are as dull as their readers. There are probably words
  addressed to our condition exactly, which, if we could really hear and understand,
  would be more salutary than the morning or the spring to our lives, and possibly put a
  new aspect on the face of things for us. How many a man has dated a new era in his life
  from the reading of a book! The book exists for us, perchance, which will explain our
  miracles and reveal new ones. The at present unutterable things we may find somewhere
  uttered. These same questions that disturb and puzzle and confound us have in their
  turn occurred to all the wise men; not one has been omitted; and each has answered
  them, according to his ability, by his words and his life. Moreover, with wisdom we
  shall learn liberality. The solitary hired man on a farm in the outskirts of Concord,
  who has had his second birth and peculiar religious experience, and is driven as he
  believes into the silent gravity and exclusiveness by his faith, may think it is not
  true; but Zoroaster, thousands of years ago, travelled the same road and had the same
  experience; but he, being wise, knew it to be universal, and treated his neighbors
  accordingly, and is even said to have invented and established worship among men. Let
  him humbly commune with Zoroaster then, and through the liberalizing influence of all
  the worthies, with Jesus Christ himself, and let "our church" go by the board.</p>

  <p>We boast that we belong to the Nineteenth Century and are making the most rapid
  strides of any nation. But consider how little this village does for its own culture. I
  do not wish to flatter my townsmen, nor to be flattered by them, for that will not
  advance either of us. We need to be provoked&#8212;goaded like oxen, as we are, into a
  trot. We have a comparatively decent system of common schools, schools for infants
  only; but excepting the half-starved Lyceum in the winter, and latterly the puny
  beginning of a library suggested by the State, no school for ourselves. We spend more
  on almost any article of bodily aliment or ailment than on our mental aliment. It is
  time that we had uncommon schools, that we did not leave off our education when we
  begin to be men and women. It is time that villages were universities, and their elder
  inhabitants the fellows of universities, with leisure&#8212;if they are, indeed, so
  well off&#8212;to pursue liberal studies the rest of their lives. Shall the world be
  confined to one Paris or one Oxford forever? Cannot students be boarded here and get a
  liberal education under the skies of Concord? Can we not hire some Abelard to lecture
  to us? Alas! what with foddering the cattle and tending the store, we are kept from
  school too long, and our education is sadly neglected. In this country, the village
  should in some respects take the place of the nobleman of Europe. It should be the
  patron of the fine arts. It is rich enough. It wants only the magnanimity and
  refinement. It can spend money enough on such things as farmers and traders value, but
  it is thought Utopian to propose spending money for things which more intelligent men
  know to be of far more worth. This town has spent seventeen thousand dollars on a
  town-house, thank fortune or politics, but probably it will not spend so much on living
  wit, the true meat to put into that shell, in a hundred years. The one hundred and
  twenty-five dollars annually subscribed for a Lyceum in the winter is better spent than
  any other equal sum raised in the town. If we live in the Nineteenth Century, why
  should we not enjoy the advantages which the Nineteenth Century offers? Why should our
  life be in any respect provincial? If we will read newspapers, why not skip the gossip
  of Boston and take the best newspaper in the world at once?&#8212;not be sucking the
  pap of "neutral family" papers, or browsing "Olive Branches" here in New England. Let
  the reports of all the learned societies come to us, and we will see if they know
  anything. Why should we leave it to Harper &amp; Brothers and Redding &amp; Co. to
  select our reading? As the nobleman of cultivated taste surrounds himself with whatever
  conduces to his culture&#8212;genius&#8212;learning&#8212;wit&#8212;books&#8212;
  paintings&#8212;statuary&#8212;music&#8212;philosophical instruments, and the like; so
  let the village do&#8212;not stop short at a pedagogue, a parson, a sexton, a parish
  library, and three selectmen, because our Pilgrim forefathers got through a cold winter
  once on a bleak rock with these. To act collectively is according to the spirit of our
  institutions; and I am confident that, as our circumstances are more flourishing, our
  means are greater than the nobleman's. New England can hire all the wise men in the
  world to come and teach her, and board them round the while, and not be provincial at
  all. That is the <i>uncommon</i> school we want. Instead of noblemen, let us have noble
  villages of men. If it is necessary, omit one bridge over the river, go round a little
  there, and throw one arch at least over the darker gulf of ignorance which surrounds
  us.</p>

  <h2>Sounds</h2>

  <p>But while we are confined to books, though the most select and classic, and read
  only particular written languages, which are themselves but dialects and provincial, we
  are in danger of forgetting the language which all things and events speak without
  metaphor, which alone is copious and standard. Much is published, but little printed.
  The rays which stream through the shutter will be no longer remembered when the shutter
  is wholly removed. No method nor discipline can supersede the necessity of being
  forever on the alert. What is a course of history or philosophy, or poetry, no matter
  how well selected, or the best society, or the most admirable routine of life, compared
  with the discipline of looking always at what is to be seen? Will you be a reader, a
  student merely, or a seer? Read your fate, see what is before you, and walk on into
  futurity.</p>

  <p>I did not read books the first summer; I hoed beans. Nay, I often did better than
  this. There were times when I could not afford to sacrifice the bloom of the present
  moment to any work, whether of the head or hands. I love a broad margin to my life.
  Sometimes, in a summer morning, having taken my accustomed bath, I sat in my sunny
  doorway from sunrise till noon, rapt in a revery, amidst the pines and hickories and
  sumachs, in undisturbed solitude and stillness, while the birds sing around or flitted
  noiseless through the house, until by the sun falling in at my west window, or the
  noise of some traveller's wagon on the distant highway, I was reminded of the lapse of
  time. I grew in those seasons like corn in the night, and they were far better than any
  work of the hands would have been. They were not time subtracted from my life, but so
  much over and above my usual allowance. I realized what the Orientals mean by
  contemplation and the forsaking of works. For the most part, I minded not how the hours
  went. The day advanced as if to light some work of mine; it was morning, and lo, now it
  is evening, and nothing memorable is accomplished. Instead of singing like the birds, I
  silently smiled at my incessant good fortune. As the sparrow had its trill, sitting on
  the hickory before my door, so had I my chuckle or suppressed warble which he might
  hear out of my nest. My days were not days of the week, bearing the stamp of any
  heathen deity, nor were they minced into hours and fretted by the ticking of a clock;
  for I lived like the Puri Indians, of whom it is said that "for yesterday, today, and
  tomorrow they have only one word, and they express the variety of meaning by pointing
  backward for yesterday forward for tomorrow, and overhead for the passing day." This
  was sheer idleness to my fellow-townsmen, no doubt; but if the birds and flowers had
  tried me by their standard, I should not have been found wanting. A man must find his
  occasions in himself, it is true. The natural day is very calm, and will hardly reprove
  his indolence.</p>

  <p>I had this advantage, at least, in my mode of life, over those who were obliged to
  look abroad for amusement, to society and the theatre, that my life itself was become
  my amusement and never ceased to be novel. It was a drama of many scenes and without an
  end. If we were always, indeed, getting our living, and regulating our lives according
  to the last and best mode we had learned, we should never be troubled with ennui.
  Follow your genius closely enough, and it will not fail to show you a fresh prospect
  every hour. Housework was a pleasant pastime. When my floor was dirty, I rose early,
  and, setting all my furniture out of doors on the grass, bed and bedstead making but
  one budget, dashed water on the floor, and sprinkled white sand from the pond on it,
  and then with a broom scrubbed it clean and white; and by the time the villagers had
  broken their fast the morning sun had dried my house sufficiently to allow me to move
  in again, and my meditations were almost uninterupted. It was pleasant to see my whole
  household effects out on the grass, making a little pile like a gypsy's pack, and my
  three-legged table, from which I did not remove the books and pen and ink, standing
  amid the pines and hickories. They seemed glad to get out themselves, and as if
  unwilling to be brought in. I was sometimes tempted to stretch an awning over them and
  take my seat there. It was worth the while to see the sun shine on these things, and
  hear the free wind blow on them; so much more interesting most familiar objects look
  out of doors than in the house. A bird sits on the next bough, life-everlasting grows
  under the table, and blackberry vines run round its legs; pine cones, chestnut burs,
  and strawberry leaves are strewn about. It looked as if this was the way these forms
  came to be transferred to our furniture, to tables, chairs, and bedsteads&#8212;because
  they once stood in their midst.</p>

  <p>My house was on the side of a hill, immediately on the edge of the larger wood, in
  the midst of a young forest of pitch pines and hickories, and half a dozen rods from
  the pond, to which a narrow footpath led down the hill. In my front yard grew the
  strawberry, blackberry, and life-everlasting, johnswort and goldenrod, shrub oaks and
  sand cherry, blueberry and groundnut. Near the end of May, the sand cherry (<i>Cerasus
  pumila</i>) adorned the sides of the path with its delicate flowers arranged in umbels
  cylindrically about its short stems, which last, in the fall, weighed down with
  good-sized and handsome cherries, fell over in wreaths like rays on every side. I
  tasted them out of compliment to Nature, though they were scarcely palatable. The
  sumach (<i>Rhus glabra</i>) grew luxuriantly about the house, pushing up through the
  embankment which I had made, and growing five or six feet the first season. Its broad
  pinnate tropical leaf was pleasant though strange to look on. The large buds, suddenly
  pushing out late in the spring from dry sticks which had seemed to be dead, developed
  themselves as by magic into graceful green and tender boughs, an inch in diameter; and
  sometimes, as I sat at my window, so heedlessly did they grow and tax their weak
  joints, I heard a fresh and tender bough suddenly fall like a fan to the ground, when
  there was not a breath of air stirring, broken off by its own weight. In August, the
  large masses of berries, which, when in flower, had attracted many wild bees, gradually
  assumed their bright velvety crimson hue, and by their weight again bent down and broke
  the tender limbs.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>As I sit at my window this summer afternoon, hawks are circling about my clearing;
  the tantivy of wild pigeons, flying by two and threes athwart my view, or perching
  restless on the white pine boughs behind my house, gives a voice to the air; a fish
  hawk dimples the glassy surface of the pond and brings up a fish; a mink steals out of
  the marsh before my door and seizes a frog by the shore; the sedge is bending under the
  weight of the reed-birds flitting hither and thither; and for the last half-hour I have
  heard the rattle of railroad cars, now dying away and then reviving like the beat of a
  partridge, conveying travellers from Boston to the country. For I did not live so out
  of the world as that boy who, as I hear, was put out to a farmer in the east part of
  the town, but ere long ran away and came home again, quite down at the heel and
  homesick. He had never seen such a dull and out-of-the-way place; the folks were all
  gone off; why, you couldn't even hear the whistle! I doubt if there is such a place in
  Massachusetts now:&#8212;</p>
  <pre>      "In truth, our village has become a butt
       For one of those fleet railroad shafts, and o'er
       Our peaceful plain its soothing sound is&#8212;Concord."
</pre>

  <p class="nind">The Fitchburg Railroad touches the pond about a hundred rods south of
  where I dwell. I usually go to the village along its causeway, and am, as it were,
  related to society by this link. The men on the freight trains, who go over the whole
  length of the road, bow to me as to an old acquaintance, they pass me so often, and
  apparently they take me for an employee; and so I am. I too would fain be a
  track-repairer somewhere in the orbit of the earth.</p>

  <p>The whistle of the locomotive penetrates my woods summer and winter, sounding like
  the scream of a hawk sailing over some farmer's yard, informing me that many restless
  city merchants are arriving within the circle of the town, or adventurous country
  traders from the other side. As they come under one horizon, they shout their warning
  to get off the track to the other, heard sometimes through the circles of two towns.
  Here come your groceries, country; your rations, countrymen! Nor is there any man so
  independent on his farm that he can say them nay. And here's your pay for them! screams
  the countryman's whistle; timber like long battering-rams going twenty miles an hour
  against the city's walls, and chairs enough to seat all the weary and heavy-laden that
  dwell within them. With such huge and lumbering civility the country hands a chair to
  the city. All the Indian huckleberry hills are stripped, all the cranberry meadows are
  raked into the city. Up comes the cotton, down goes the woven cloth; up comes the silk,
  down goes the woollen; up come the books, but down goes the wit that writes them.</p>

  <p>When I meet the engine with its train of cars moving off with planetary
  motion&#8212;or, rather, like a comet, for the beholder knows not if with that velocity
  and with that direction it will ever revisit this system, since its orbit does not look
  like a returning curve&#8212;with its steam cloud like a banner streaming behind in
  golden and silver wreaths, like many a downy cloud which I have seen, high in the
  heavens, unfolding its masses to the light&#8212;as if this traveling demigod, this
  cloud-compeller, would ere long take the sunset sky for the livery of his train; when I
  hear the iron horse make the hills echo with his snort like thunder, shaking the earth
  with his feet, and breathing fire and smoke from his nostrils (what kind of winged
  horse or fiery dragon they will put into the new Mythology I don't know), it seems as
  if the earth had got a race now worthy to inhabit it. If all were as it seems, and men
  made the elements their servants for noble ends! If the cloud that hangs over the
  engine were the perspiration of heroic deeds, or as beneficent as that which floats
  over the farmer's fields, then the elements and Nature herself would cheerfully
  accompany men on their errands and be their escort.</p>

  <p>I watch the passage of the morning cars with the same feeling that I do the rising
  of the sun, which is hardly more regular. Their train of clouds stretching far behind
  and rising higher and higher, going to heaven while the cars are going to Boston,
  conceals the sun for a minute and casts my distant field into the shade, a celestial
  train beside which the petty train of cars which hugs the earth is but the barb of the
  spear. The stabler of the iron horse was up early this winter morning by the light of
  the stars amid the mountains, to fodder and harness his steed. Fire, too, was awakened
  thus early to put the vital heat in him and get him off. If the enterprise were as
  innocent as it is early! If the snow lies deep, they strap on his snowshoes, and, with
  the giant plow, plow a furrow from the mountains to the seaboard, in which the cars,
  like a following drill-barrow, sprinkle all the restless men and floating merchandise
  in the country for seed. All day the fire-steed flies over the country, stopping only
  that his master may rest, and I am awakened by his tramp and defiant snort at midnight,
  when in some remote glen in the woods he fronts the elements incased in ice and snow;
  and he will reach his stall only with the morning star, to start once more on his
  travels without rest or slumber. Or perchance, at evening, I hear him in his stable
  blowing off the superfluous energy of the day, that he may calm his nerves and cool his
  liver and brain for a few hours of iron slumber. If the enterprise were as heroic and
  commanding as it is protracted and unwearied!</p>

  <p>Far through unfrequented woods on the confines of towns, where once only the hunter
  penetrated by day, in the darkest night dart these bright saloons without the knowledge
  of their inhabitants; this moment stopping at some brilliant station-house in town or
  city, where a social crowd is gathered, the next in the Dismal Swamp, scaring the owl
  and fox. The startings and arrivals of the cars are now the epochs in the village day.
  They go and come with such regularity and precision, and their whistle can be heard so
  far, that the farmers set their clocks by them, and thus one well-conducted institution
  regulates a whole country. Have not men improved somewhat in punctuality since the
  railroad was invented? Do they not talk and think faster in the depot than they did in
  the stage-office? There is something electrifying in the atmosphere of the former
  place. I have been astonished at the miracles it has wrought; that some of my
  neighbors, who, I should have prophesied, once for all, would never get to Boston by so
  prompt a conveyance, are on hand when the bell rings. To do things "railroad fashion"
  is now the byword; and it is worth the while to be warned so often and so sincerely by
  any power to get off its track. There is no stopping to read the riot act, no firing
  over the heads of the mob, in this case. We have constructed a fate, an <i>Atropos</i>,
  that never turns aside. (Let that be the name of your engine.) Men are advertised that
  at a certain hour and minute these bolts will be shot toward particular points of the
  compass; yet it interferes with no man's business, and the children go to school on the
  other track. We live the steadier for it. We are all educated thus to be sons of Tell.
  The air is full of invisible bolts. Every path but your own is the path of fate. Keep
  on your own track, then.</p>

  <p>What recommends commerce to me is its enterprise and bravery. It does not clasp its
  hands and pray to Jupiter. I see these men every day go about their business with more
  or less courage and content, doing more even than they suspect, and perchance better
  employed than they could have consciously devised. I am less affected by their heroism
  who stood up for half an hour in the front line at Buena Vista, than by the steady and
  cheerful valor of the men who inhabit the snowplow for their winter quarters; who have
  not merely the three-o'-clock-in-the-morning courage, which Bonaparte thought was the
  rarest, but whose courage does not go to rest so early, who go to sleep only when the
  storm sleeps or the sinews of their iron steed are frozen. On this morning of the Great
  Snow, perchance, which is still raging and chilling men's blood, I bear the muffled
  tone of their engine bell from out the fog bank of their chilled breath, which
  announces that the cars <i>are coming</i>, without long delay, notwithstanding the veto
  of a New England northeast snow-storm, and I behold the plowmen covered with snow and
  rime, their heads peering, above the mould-board which is turning down other than
  daisies and the nests of field mice, like bowlders of the Sierra Nevada, that occupy an
  outside place in the universe.</p>

  <p>Commerce is unexpectedly confident and serene, alert, adventurous, and unwearied. It
  is very natural in its methods withal, far more so than many fantastic enterprises and
  sentimental experiments, and hence its singular success. I am refreshed and expanded
  when the freight train rattles past me, and I smell the stores which go dispensing
  their odors all the way from Long Wharf to Lake Champlain, reminding me of foreign
  parts, of coral reefs, and Indian oceans, and tropical climes, and the extent of the
  globe. I feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palm-leaf which will
  cover so many flaxen New England heads the next summer, the Manilla hemp and cocoanut
  husks, the old junk, gunny bags, scrap iron, and rusty nails. This carload of torn
  sails is more legible and interesting now than if they should be wrought into paper and
  printed books. Who can write so graphically the history of the storms they have
  weathered as these rents have done? They are proof-sheets which need no correction.
  Here goes lumber from the Maine woods, which did not go out to sea in the last freshet,
  risen four dollars on the thousand because of what did go out or was split up; pine,
  spruce, cedar&#8212;first, second, third, and fourth qualities, so lately all of one
  quality, to wave over the bear, and moose, and caribou. Next rolls Thomaston lime, a
  prime lot, which will get far among the hills before it gets slacked. These rags in
  bales, of all hues and qualities, the lowest condition to which cotton and linen
  descend, the final result of dress&#8212;of patterns which are now no longer cried up,
  unless it be in Milwaukee, as those splendid articles, English, French, or American
  prints, ginghams, muslins, etc., gathered from all quarters both of fashion and
  poverty, going to become paper of one color or a few shades only, on which, forsooth,
  will be written tales of real life, high and low, and founded on fact! This closed car
  smells of salt fish, the strong New England and commercial scent, reminding me of the
  Grand Banks and the fisheries. Who has not seen a salt fish, thoroughly cured for this
  world, so that nothing can spoil it, and putting the perseverance of the saints to the
  blush? with which you may sweep or pave the streets, and split your kindlings, and the
  teamster shelter himself and his lading against sun, wind, and rain behind it&#8212;and
  the trader, as a Concord trader once did, hang it up by his door for a sign when he
  commences business, until at last his oldest customer cannot tell surely whether it be
  animal, vegetable, or mineral, and yet it shall be as pure as a snowflake, and if it be
  put into a pot and boiled, will come out an excellent dun-fish for a Saturday's dinner.
  Next Spanish hides, with the tails still preserving their twist and the angle of
  elevation they had when the oxen that wore them were careering over the pampas of the
  Spanish Main&#8212;a type of all obstinacy, and evincing how almost hopeless and
  incurable are all constitutional vices. I confess, that practically speaking, when I
  have learned a man's real disposition, I have no hopes of changing it for the better or
  worse in this state of existence. As the Orientals say, "A cur's tail may be warmed,
  and pressed, and bound round with ligatures, and after a twelve years' labor bestowed
  upon it, still it will retain its natural form." The only effectual cure for such
  inveteracies as these tails exhibit is to make glue of them, which I believe is what is
  usually done with them, and then they will stay put and stick. Here is a hogshead of
  molasses or of brandy directed to John Smith, Cuttingsville, Vermont, some trader among
  the Green Mountains, who imports for the farmers near his clearing, and now perchance
  stands over his bulkhead and thinks of the last arrivals on the coast, how they may
  affect the price for him, telling his customers this moment, as he has told them twenty
  times before this morning, that he expects some by the next train of prime quality. It
  is advertised in the Cuttingsville Times.</p>

  <p>While these things go up other things come down. Warned by the whizzing sound, I
  look up from my book and see some tall pine, hewn on far northern hills, which has
  winged its way over the Green Mountains and the Connecticut, shot like an arrow through
  the township within ten minutes, and scarce another eye beholds it; going</p>
  <pre>                          "to be the mast
                 Of some great ammiral."
</pre>

  <p class="nind">And hark! here comes the cattle-train bearing the cattle of a thousand
  hills, sheepcots, stables, and cow-yards in the air, drovers with their sticks, and
  shepherd boys in the midst of their flocks, all but the mountain pastures, whirled
  along like leaves blown from the mountains by the September gales. The air is filled
  with the bleating of calves and sheep, and the hustling of oxen, as if a pastoral
  valley were going by. When the old bell-wether at the head rattles his bell, the
  mountains do indeed skip like rams and the little hills like lambs. A carload of
  drovers, too, in the midst, on a level with their droves now, their vocation gone, but
  still clinging to their useless sticks as their badge of office. But their dogs, where
  are they? It is a stampede to them; they are quite thrown out; they have lost the
  scent. Methinks I hear them barking behind the Peterboro' Hills, or panting up the
  western slope of the Green Mountains. They will not be in at the death. Their vocation,
  too, is gone. Their fidelity and sagacity are below par now. They will slink back to
  their kennels in disgrace, or perchance run wild and strike a league with the wolf and
  the fox. So is your pastoral life whirled past and away. But the bell rings, and I must
  get off the track and let the cars go by;&#8212;</p>
  <pre>                  What's the railroad to me?
                  I never go to see
                  Where it ends.
                  It fills a few hollows,
                  And makes banks for the swallows,
                  It sets the sand a-blowing,
                  And the blackberries a-growing,
</pre>

  <p class="nind">but I cross it like a cart-path in the woods. I will not have my eyes
  put out and my ears spoiled by its smoke and steam and hissing.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>Now that the cars are gone by and all the restless world with them, and the fishes
  in the pond no longer feel their rumbling, I am more alone than ever. For the rest of
  the long afternoon, perhaps, my meditations are interrupted only by the faint rattle of
  a carriage or team along the distant highway.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, on Sundays, I heard the bells, the Lincoln, Acton, Bedford, or Concord
  bell, when the wind was favorable, a faint, sweet, and, as it were, natural melody,
  worth importing into the wilderness. At a sufficient distance over the woods this sound
  acquires a certain vibratory hum, as if the pine needles in the horizon were the
  strings of a harp which it swept. All sound heard at the greatest possible distance
  produces one and the same effect, a vibration of the universal lyre, just as the
  intervening atmosphere makes a distant ridge of earth interesting to our eyes by the
  azure tint it imparts to it. There came to me in this case a melody which the air had
  strained, and which had conversed with every leaf and needle of the wood, that portion
  of the sound which the elements had taken up and modulated and echoed from vale to
  vale. The echo is, to some extent, an original sound, and therein is the magic and
  charm of it. It is not merely a repetition of what was worth repeating in the bell, but
  partly the voice of the wood; the same trivial words and notes sung by a
  wood-nymph.</p>

  <p>At evening, the distant lowing of some cow in the horizon beyond the woods sounded
  sweet and melodious, and at first I would mistake it for the voices of certain
  minstrels by whom I was sometimes serenaded, who might be straying over hill and dale;
  but soon I was not unpleasantly disappointed when it was prolonged into the cheap and
  natural music of the cow. I do not mean to be satirical, but to express my appreciation
  of those youths' singing, when I state that I perceived clearly that it was akin to the
  music of the cow, and they were at length one articulation of Nature.</p>

  <p>Regularly at half-past seven, in one part of the summer, after the evening train had
  gone by, the whip-poor-wills chanted their vespers for half an hour, sitting on a stump
  by my door, or upon the ridge-pole of the house. They would begin to sing almost with
  as much precision as a clock, within five minutes of a particular time, referred to the
  setting of the sun, every evening. I had a rare opportunity to become acquainted with
  their habits. Sometimes I heard four or five at once in different parts of the wood, by
  accident one a bar behind another, and so near me that I distinguished not only the
  cluck after each note, but often that singular buzzing sound like a fly in a spider's
  web, only proportionally louder. Sometimes one would circle round and round me in the
  woods a few feet distant as if tethered by a string, when probably I was near its eggs.
  They sang at intervals throughout the night, and were again as musical as ever just
  before and about dawn.</p>

  <p>When other birds are still, the screech owls take up the strain, like mourning women
  their ancient u-lu-lu. Their dismal scream is truly Ben Jonsonian. Wise midnight hags!
  It is no honest and blunt tu-whit tu-who of the poets, but, without jesting, a most
  solemn graveyard ditty, the mutual consolations of suicide lovers remembering the pangs
  and the delights of supernal love in the infernal groves. Yet I love to hear their
  wailing, their doleful responses, trilled along the woodside; reminding me sometimes of
  music and singing birds; as if it were the dark and tearful side of music, the regrets
  and sighs that would fain be sung. They are the spirits, the low spirits and melancholy
  forebodings, of fallen souls that once in human shape night-walked the earth and did
  the deeds of darkness, now expiating their sins with their wailing hymns or threnodies
  in the scenery of their transgressions. They give me a new sense of the variety and
  capacity of that nature which is our common dwelling. <i>Oh-o-o-o-o that I never had
  been bor-r-r-r-n!</i> sighs one on this side of the pond, and circles with the
  restlessness of despair to some new perch on the gray oaks. Then&#8212;<i>that I never
  had been bor-r-r-r-n!</i> echoes another on the farther side with tremulous sincerity,
  and&#8212;<i>bor-r-r-r-n!</i> comes faintly from far in the Lincoln woods.</p>

  <p>I was also serenaded by a hooting owl. Near at hand you could fancy it the most
  melancholy sound in Nature, as if she meant by this to stereotype and make permanent in
  her choir the dying moans of a human being&#8212;some poor weak relic of mortality who
  has left hope behind, and howls like an animal, yet with human sobs, on entering the
  dark valley, made more awful by a certain gurgling melodiousness&#8212;I find myself
  beginning with the letters <i>gl</i> when I try to imitate it&#8212;expressive of a
  mind which has reached the gelatinous, mildewy stage in the mortification of all
  healthy and courageous thought. It reminded me of ghouls and idiots and insane
  howlings. But now one answers from far woods in a strain made really melodious by
  distance&#8212;<i>Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer hoo</i>; and indeed for the most part it
  suggested only pleasing associations, whether heard by day or night, summer or
  winter.</p>

  <p>I rejoice that there are owls. Let them do the idiotic and maniacal hooting for men.
  It is a sound admirably suited to swamps and twilight woods which no day illustrates,
  suggesting a vast and undeveloped nature which men have not recognized. They represent
  the stark twilight and unsatisfied thoughts which all have. All day the sun has shone
  on the surface of some savage swamp, where the single spruce stands hung with usnea
  lichens, and small hawks circulate above, and the chickadee lisps amid the evergreens,
  and the partridge and rabbit skulk beneath; but now a more dismal and fitting day
  dawns, and a different race of creatures awakes to express the meaning of Nature
  there.</p>

  <p>Late in the evening I heard the distant rumbling of wagons over bridges&#8212;a
  sound heard farther than almost any other at night&#8212;the baying of dogs, and
  sometimes again the lowing of some disconsolate cow in a distant barn-yard. In the
  mean-while all the shore rang with the trump of bullfrogs, the sturdy spirits of
  ancient wine-bibbers and wassailers, still unrepentant, trying to sing a catch in their
  Stygian lake&#8212;if the Walden nymphs will pardon the comparison, for though there
  are almost no weeds, there are frogs there&#8212;who would fain keep up the hilarious
  rules of their old festal tables, though their voices have waxed hoarse and solemnly
  grave, mocking at mirth, and the wine has lost its flavor, and become only liquor to
  distend their paunches, and sweet intoxication never comes to drown the memory of the
  past, but mere saturation and waterloggedness and distention. The most aldermanic, with
  his chin upon a heart-leaf, which serves for a napkin to his drooling chaps, under this
  northern shore quaffs a deep draught of the once scorned water, and passes round the
  cup with the ejaculation <i>tr-r-r-oonk, tr-r-r&#8212;oonk, tr-r-r-oonk!</i> and
  straightway comes over the water from some distant cove the same password repeated,
  where the next in seniority and girth has gulped down to his mark; and when this
  observance has made the circuit of the shores, then ejaculates the master of
  ceremonies, with satisfaction, <i>tr-r-r-oonk!</i> and each in his turn repeats the
  same down to the least distended, leakiest, and flabbiest paunched, that there be no
  mistake; and then the howl goes round again and again, until the sun disperses the
  morning mist, and only the patriarch is not under the pond, but vainly bellowing
  <i>troonk</i> from time to time, and pausing for a reply.</p>

  <p>I am not sure that I ever heard the sound of cock-crowing from my clearing, and I
  thought that it might be worth the while to keep a cockerel for his music merely, as a
  singing bird. The note of this once wild Indian pheasant is certainly the most
  remarkable of any bird's, and if they could be naturalized without being domesticated,
  it would soon become the most famous sound in our woods, surpassing the clangor of the
  goose and the hooting of the owl; and then imagine the cackling of the hens to fill the
  pauses when their lords' clarions rested! No wonder that man added this bird to his
  tame stock&#8212;to say nothing of the eggs and drumsticks. To walk in a winter morning
  in a wood where these birds abounded, their native woods, and hear the wild cockerels
  crow on the trees, clear and shrill for miles over the resounding earth, drowning the
  feebler notes of other birds&#8212;think of it! It would put nations on the alert. Who
  would not be early to rise, and rise earlier and earlier every successive day of his
  life, till he became unspeakably healthy, wealthy, and wise? This foreign bird's note
  is celebrated by the poets of all countries along with the notes of their native
  songsters. All climates agree with brave Chanticleer. He is more indigenous even than
  the natives. His health is ever good, his lungs are sound, his spirits never flag. Even
  the sailor on the Atlantic and Pacific is awakened by his voice; but its shrill sound
  never roused me from my slumbers. I kept neither dog, cat, cow, pig, nor hens, so that
  you would have said there was a deficiency of domestic sounds; neither the churn, nor
  the spinning-wheel, nor even the singing of the kettle, nor the hissing of the urn, nor
  children crying, to comfort one. An old-fashioned man would have lost his senses or
  died of ennui before this. Not even rats in the wall, for they were starved out, or
  rather were never baited in&#8212;only squirrels on the roof and under the floor, a
  whip-poor-will on the ridge-pole, a blue jay screaming beneath the window, a hare or
  woodchuck under the house, a screech owl or a cat owl behind it, a flock of wild geese
  or a laughing loon on the pond, and a fox to bark in the night. Not even a lark or an
  oriole, those mild plantation birds, ever visited my clearing. No cockerels to crow nor
  hens to cackle in the yard. No yard! but unfenced nature reaching up to your very
  sills. A young forest growing up under your meadows, and wild sumachs and blackberry
  vines breaking through into your cellar; sturdy pitch pines rubbing and creaking
  against the shingles for want of room, their roots reaching quite under the house.
  Instead of a scuttle or a blind blown off in the gale&#8212;a pine tree snapped off or
  torn up by the roots behind your house for fuel. Instead of no path to the front-yard
  gate in the Great Snow&#8212;no gate&#8212;no front-yard&#8212;and no path to the
  civilized world.</p>

  <h2>Solitude</h2>

  <p>This is a delicious evening, when the whole body is one sense, and imbibes delight
  through every pore. I go and come with a strange liberty in Nature, a part of herself.
  As I walk along the stony shore of the pond in my shirt-sleeves, though it is cool as
  well as cloudy and windy, and I see nothing special to attract me, all the elements are
  unusually congenial to me. The bullfrogs trump to usher in the night, and the note of
  the whip-poor-will is borne on the rippling wind from over the water. Sympathy with the
  fluttering alder and poplar leaves almost takes away my breath; yet, like the lake, my
  serenity is rippled but not ruffled. These small waves raised by the evening wind are
  as remote from storm as the smooth reflecting surface. Though it is now dark, the wind
  still blows and roars in the wood, the waves still dash, and some creatures lull the
  rest with their notes. The repose is never complete. The wildest animals do not repose,
  but seek their prey now; the fox, and skunk, and rabbit, now roam the fields and woods
  without fear. They are Nature's watchmen&#8212;links which connect the days of animated
  life.</p>

  <p>When I return to my house I find that visitors have been there and left their cards,
  either a bunch of flowers, or a wreath of evergreen, or a name in pencil on a yellow
  walnut leaf or a chip. They who come rarely to the woods take some little piece of the
  forest into their hands to play with by the way, which they leave, either intentionally
  or accidentally. One has peeled a willow wand, woven it into a ring, and dropped it on
  my table. I could always tell if visitors had called in my absence, either by the
  bended twigs or grass, or the print of their shoes, and generally of what sex or age or
  quality they were by some slight trace left, as a flower dropped, or a bunch of grass
  plucked and thrown away, even as far off as the railroad, half a mile distant, or by
  the lingering odor of a cigar or pipe. Nay, I was frequently notified of the passage of
  a traveller along the highway sixty rods off by the scent of his pipe.</p>

  <p>There is commonly sufficient space about us. Our horizon is never quite at our
  elbows. The thick wood is not just at our door, nor the pond, but somewhat is always
  clearing, familiar and worn by us, appropriated and fenced in some way, and reclaimed
  from Nature. For what reason have I this vast range and circuit, some square miles of
  unfrequented forest, for my privacy, abandoned to me by men? My nearest neighbor is a
  mile distant, and no house is visible from any place but the hill-tops within half a
  mile of my own. I have my horizon bounded by woods all to myself; a distant view of the
  railroad where it touches the pond on the one hand, and of the fence which skirts the
  woodland road on the other. But for the most part it is as solitary where I live as on
  the prairies. It is as much Asia or Africa as New England. I have, as it were, my own
  sun and moon and stars, and a little world all to myself. At night there was never a
  traveller passed my house, or knocked at my door, more than if I were the first or last
  man; unless it were in the spring, when at long intervals some came from the village to
  fish for pouts&#8212;they plainly fished much more in the Walden Pond of their own
  natures, and baited their hooks with darkness&#8212;but they soon retreated, usually
  with light baskets, and left "the world to darkness and to me," and the black kernel of
  the night was never profaned by any human neighborhood. I believe that men are
  generally still a little afraid of the dark, though the witches are all hung, and
  Christianity and candles have been introduced.</p>

  <p>Yet I experienced sometimes that the most sweet and tender, the most innocent and
  encouraging society may be found in any natural object, even for the poor misanthrope
  and most melancholy man. There can be no very black melancholy to him who lives in the
  midst of Nature and has his senses still. There was never yet such a storm but it was
  &#198;olian music to a healthy and innocent ear. Nothing can rightly compel a simple
  and brave man to a vulgar sadness. While I enjoy the friendship of the seasons I trust
  that nothing can make life a burden to me. The gentle rain which waters my beans and
  keeps me in the house today is not drear and melancholy, but good for me too. Though it
  prevents my hoeing them, it is of far more worth than my hoeing. If it should continue
  so long as to cause the seeds to rot in the ground and destroy the potatoes in the low
  lands, it would still be good for the grass on the uplands, and, being good for the
  grass, it would be good for me. Sometimes, when I compare myself with other men, it
  seems as if I were more favored by the gods than they, beyond any deserts that I am
  conscious of; as if I had a warrant and surety at their hands which my fellows have
  not, and were especially guided and guarded. I do not flatter myself, but if it be
  possible they flatter me. I have never felt lonesome, or in the least oppressed by a
  sense of solitude, but once, and that was a few weeks after I came to the woods, when,
  for an hour, I doubted if the near neighborhood of man was not essential to a serene
  and healthy life. To be alone was something unpleasant. But I was at the same time
  conscious of a slight insanity in my mood, and seemed to foresee my recovery. In the
  midst of a gentle rain while these thoughts prevailed, I was suddenly sensible of such
  sweet and beneficent society in Nature, in the very pattering of the drops, and in
  every sound and sight around my house, an infinite and unaccountable friendliness all
  at once like an atmosphere sustaining me, as made the fancied advantages of human
  neighborhood insignificant, and I have never thought of them since. Every little pine
  needle expanded and swelled with sympathy and befriended me. I was so distinctly made
  aware of the presence of something kindred to me, even in scenes which we are
  accustomed to call wild and dreary, and also that the nearest of blood to me and
  humanest was not a person nor a villager, that I thought no place could ever be strange
  to me again.</p>
  <pre>          "Mourning untimely consumes the sad;
           Few are their days in the land of the living,
           Beautiful daughter of Toscar."
</pre>

  <p class="nind">Some of my pleasantest hours were during the long rain-storms in the
  spring or fall, which confined me to the house for the afternoon as well as the
  forenoon, soothed by their ceaseless roar and pelting; when an early twilight ushered
  in a long evening in which many thoughts had time to take root and unfold themselves.
  In those driving northeast rains which tried the village houses so, when the maids
  stood ready with mop and pail in front entries to keep the deluge out, I sat behind my
  door in my little house, which was all entry, and thoroughly enjoyed its protection. In
  one heavy thunder-shower the lightning struck a large pitch pine across the pond,
  making a very conspicuous and perfectly regular spiral groove from top to bottom, an
  inch or more deep, and four or five inches wide, as you would groove a walking-stick. I
  passed it again the other day, and was struck with awe on looking up and beholding that
  mark, now more distinct than ever, where a terrific and resistless bolt came down out
  of the harmless sky eight years ago. Men frequently say to me, "I should think you
  would feel lonesome down there, and want to be nearer to folks, rainy and snowy days
  and nights especially." I am tempted to reply to such&#8212;This whole earth which we
  inhabit is but a point in space. How far apart, think you, dwell the two most distant
  inhabitants of yonder star, the breadth of whose disk cannot be appreciated by our
  instruments? Why should I feel lonely? is not our planet in the Milky Way? This which
  you put seems to me not to be the most important question. What sort of space is that
  which separates a man from his fellows and makes him solitary? I have found that no
  exertion of the legs can bring two minds much nearer to one another. What do we want
  most to dwell near to? Not to many men surely, the depot, the post-office, the
  bar-room, the meeting-house, the school-house, the grocery, Beacon Hill, or the Five
  Points, where men most congregate, but to the perennial source of our life, whence in
  all our experience we have found that to issue, as the willow stands near the water and
  sends out its roots in that direction. This will vary with different natures, but this
  is the place where a wise man will dig his cellar.... I one evening overtook one of my
  townsmen, who has accumulated what is called "a handsome property"&#8212;though I never
  got a <i>fair</i> view of it&#8212;on the Walden road, driving a pair of cattle to
  market, who inquired of me how I could bring my mind to give up so many of the comforts
  of life. I answered that I was very sure I liked it passably well; I was not joking.
  And so I went home to my bed, and left him to pick his way through the darkness and the
  mud to Brighton&#8212;or Bright-town&#8212;which place he would reach some time in the
  morning.</p>

  <p>Any prospect of awakening or coming to life to a dead man makes indifferent all
  times and places. The place where that may occur is always the same, and indescribably
  pleasant to all our senses. For the most part we allow only outlying and transient
  circumstances to make our occasions. They are, in fact, the cause of our distraction.
  Nearest to all things is that power which fashions their being. <i>Next</i> to us the
  grandest laws are continually being executed. <i>Next</i> to us is not the workman whom
  we have hired, with whom we love so well to talk, but the workman whose work we
  are.</p>

  <p>"How vast and profound is the influence of the subtile powers of Heaven and of
  Earth!"</p>

  <p>"We seek to perceive them, and we do not see them; we seek to hear them, and we do
  not hear them; identified with the substance of things, they cannot be separated from
  them."</p>

  <p>"They cause that in all the universe men purify and sanctify their hearts, and
  clothe themselves in their holiday garments to offer sacrifices and oblations to their
  ancestors. It is an ocean of subtile intelligences. They are everywhere, above us, on
  our left, on our right; they environ us on all sides."</p>

  <p>We are the subjects of an experiment which is not a little interesting to me. Can we
  not do without the society of our gossips a little while under these
  circumstances&#8212;have our own thoughts to cheer us? Confucius says truly, "Virtue
  does not remain as an abandoned orphan; it must of necessity have neighbors."</p>

  <p>With thinking we may be beside ourselves in a sane sense. By a conscious effort of
  the mind we can stand aloof from actions and their consequences; and all things, good
  and bad, go by us like a torrent. We are not wholly involved in Nature. I may be either
  the driftwood in the stream, or Indra in the sky looking down on it. I <i>may</i> be
  affected by a theatrical exhibition; on the other hand, I <i>may not</i> be affected by
  an actual event which appears to concern me much more. I only know myself as a human
  entity; the scene, so to speak, of thoughts and affections; and am sensible of a
  certain doubleness by which I can stand as remote from myself as from another. However
  intense my experience, I am conscious of the presence and criticism of a part of me,
  which, as it were, is not a part of me, but spectator, sharing no experience, but
  taking note of it, and that is no more I than it is you. When the play, it may be the
  tragedy, of life is over, the spectator goes his way. It was a kind of fiction, a work
  of the imagination only, so far as he was concerned. This doubleness may easily make us
  poor neighbors and friends sometimes.</p>

  <p>I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. To be in company, even
  with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love to be alone. I never found the
  companion that was so companionable as solitude. We are for the most part more lonely
  when we go abroad among men than when we stay in our chambers. A man thinking or
  working is always alone, let him be where he will. Solitude is not measured by the
  miles of space that intervene between a man and his fellows. The really diligent
  student in one of the crowded hives of Cambridge College is as solitary as a dervish in
  the desert. The farmer can work alone in the field or the woods all day, hoeing or
  chopping, and not feel lonesome, because he is employed; but when he comes home at
  night he cannot sit down in a room alone, at the mercy of his thoughts, but must be
  where he can "see the folks," and recreate, and, as he thinks, remunerate himself for
  his day's solitude; and hence he wonders how the student can sit alone in the house all
  night and most of the day without ennui and "the blues"; but he does not realize that
  the student, though in the house, is still at work in <i>his</i> field, and chopping in
  <i>his</i> woods, as the farmer in his, and in turn seeks the same recreation and
  society that the latter does, though it may be a more condensed form of it.</p>

  <p>Society is commonly too cheap. We meet at very short intervals, not having had time
  to acquire any new value for each other. We meet at meals three times a day, and give
  each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are. We have had to agree on a
  certain set of rules, called etiquette and politeness, to make this frequent meeting
  tolerable and that we need not come to open war. We meet at the post-office, and at the
  sociable, and about the fireside every night; we live thick and are in each other's
  way, and stumble over one another, and I think that we thus lose some respect for one
  another. Certainly less frequency would suffice for all important and hearty
  communications. Consider the girls in a factory&#8212;never alone, hardly in their
  dreams. It would be better if there were but one inhabitant to a square mile, as where
  I live. The value of a man is not in his skin, that we should touch him.</p>

  <p>I have heard of a man lost in the woods and dying of famine and exhaustion at the
  foot of a tree, whose loneliness was relieved by the grotesque visions with which,
  owing to bodily weakness, his diseased imagination surrounded him, and which he
  believed to be real. So also, owing to bodily and mental health and strength, we may be
  continually cheered by a like but more normal and natural society, and come to know
  that we are never alone.</p>

  <p>I have a great deal of company in my house; especially in the morning, when nobody
  calls. Let me suggest a few comparisons, that some one may convey an idea of my
  situation. I am no more lonely than the loon in the pond that laughs so loud, or than
  Walden Pond itself. What company has that lonely lake, I pray? And yet it has not the
  blue devils, but the blue angels in it, in the azure tint of its waters. The sun is
  alone, except in thick weather, when there sometimes appear to be two, but one is a
  mock sun. God is alone&#8212;but the devil, he is far from being alone; he sees a great
  deal of company; he is legion. I am no more lonely than a single mullein or dandelion
  in a pasture, or a bean leaf, or sorrel, or a horse-fly, or a bumblebee. I am no more
  lonely than the Mill Brook, or a weathercock, or the north star, or the south wind, or
  an April shower, or a January thaw, or the first spider in a new house.</p>

  <p>I have occasional visits in the long winter evenings, when the snow falls fast and
  the wind howls in the wood, from an old settler and original proprietor, who is
  reported to have dug Walden Pond, and stoned it, and fringed it with pine woods; who
  tells me stories of old time and of new eternity; and between us we manage to pass a
  cheerful evening with social mirth and pleasant views of things, even without apples or
  cider&#8212;a most wise and humorous friend, whom I love much, who keeps himself more
  secret than ever did Goffe or Whalley; and though he is thought to be dead, none can
  show where he is buried. An elderly dame, too, dwells in my neighborhood, invisible to
  most persons, in whose odorous herb garden I love to stroll sometimes, gathering
  simples and listening to her fables; for she has a genius of unequalled fertility, and
  her memory runs back farther than mythology, and she can tell me the original of every
  fable, and on what fact every one is founded, for the incidents occurred when she was
  young. A ruddy and lusty old dame, who delights in all weathers and seasons, and is
  likely to outlive all her children yet.</p>

  <p>The indescribable innocence and beneficence of Nature&#8212;of sun and wind and
  rain, of summer and winter&#8212;such health, such cheer, they afford forever! and such
  sympathy have they ever with our race, that all Nature would be affected, and the sun's
  brightness fade, and the winds would sigh humanely, and the clouds rain tears, and the
  woods shed their leaves and put on mourning in midsummer, if any man should ever for a
  just cause grieve. Shall I not have intelligence with the earth? Am I not partly leaves
  and vegetable mould myself?</p>

  <p>What is the pill which will keep us well, serene, contented? Not my or thy
  great-grandfather's, but our great-grandmother Nature's universal, vegetable, botanic
  medicines, by which she has kept herself young always, outlived so many old Parrs in
  her day, and fed her health with their decaying fatness. For my panacea, instead of one
  of those quack vials of a mixture dipped from Acheron and the Dead Sea, which come out
  of those long shallow black-schooner looking wagons which we sometimes see made to
  carry bottles, let me have a draught of undiluted morning air. Morning air! If men will
  not drink of this at the fountainhead of the day, why, then, we must even bottle up
  some and sell it in the shops, for the benefit of those who have lost their
  subscription ticket to morning time in this world. But remember, it will not keep quite
  till noonday even in the coolest cellar, but drive out the stopples long ere that and
  follow westward the steps of Aurora. I am no worshipper of Hygeia, who was the daughter
  of that old herb-doctor &#198;sculapius, and who is represented on monuments holding a
  serpent in one hand, and in the other a cup out of which the serpent sometimes drinks;
  but rather of Hebe, cup-bearer to Jupiter, who was the daughter of Juno and wild
  lettuce, and who had the power of restoring gods and men to the vigor of youth. She was
  probably the only thoroughly sound-conditioned, healthy, and robust young lady that
  ever walked the globe, and wherever she came it was spring.</p>

  <h2>Visitors</h2>

  <p>I think that I love society as much as most, and am ready enough to fasten myself
  like a bloodsucker for the time to any full-blooded man that comes in my way. I am
  naturally no hermit, but might possibly sit out the sturdiest frequenter of the
  bar-room, if my business called me thither.</p>

  <p>I had three chairs in my house; one for solitude, two for friendship, three for
  society. When visitors came in larger and unexpected numbers there was but the third
  chair for them all, but they generally economized the room by standing up. It is
  surprising how many great men and women a small house will contain. I have had
  twenty-five or thirty souls, with their bodies, at once under my roof, and yet we often
  parted without being aware that we had come very near to one another. Many of our
  houses, both public and private, with their almost innumerable apartments, their huge
  halls and their cellars for the storage of wines and other munitions of peace, appear
  to be extravagantly large for their inhabitants. They are so vast and magnificent that
  the latter seem to be only vermin which infest them. I am surprised when the herald
  blows his summons before some Tremont or Astor or Middlesex House, to see come creeping
  out over the piazza for all inhabitants a ridiculous mouse, which soon again slinks
  into some hole in the pavement.</p>

  <p>One inconvenience I sometimes experienced in so small a house, the difficulty of
  getting to a sufficient distance from my guest when we began to utter the big thoughts
  in big words. You want room for your thoughts to get into sailing trim and run a course
  or two before they make their port. The bullet of your thought must have overcome its
  lateral and ricochet motion and fallen into its last and steady course before it
  reaches the ear of the hearer, else it may plow out again through the side of his head.
  Also, our sentences wanted room to unfold and form their columns in the interval.
  Individuals, like nations, must have suitable broad and natural boundaries, even a
  considerable neutral ground, between them. I have found it a singular luxury to talk
  across the pond to a companion on the opposite side. In my house we were so near that
  we could not begin to hear&#8212;we could not speak low enough to be heard; as when you
  throw two stones into calm water so near that they break each other's undulations. If
  we are merely loquacious and loud talkers, then we can afford to stand very near
  together, cheek by jowl, and feel each other's breath; but if we speak reservedly and
  thoughtfully, we want to be farther apart, that all animal heat and moisture may have a
  chance to evaporate. If we would enjoy the most intimate society with that in each of
  us which is without, or above, being spoken to, we must not only be silent, but
  commonly so far apart bodily that we cannot possibly hear each other's voice in any
  case. Referred to this standard, speech is for the convenience of those who are hard of
  hearing; but there are many fine things which we cannot say if we have to shout. As the
  conversation began to assume a loftier and grander tone, we gradually shoved our chairs
  farther apart till they touched the wall in opposite corners, and then commonly there
  was not room enough.</p>

  <p>My "best" room, however, my withdrawing room, always ready for company, on whose
  carpet the sun rarely fell, was the pine wood behind my house. Thither in summer days,
  when distinguished guests came, I took them, and a priceless domestic swept the floor
  and dusted the furniture and kept the things in order.</p>

  <p>If one guest came he sometimes partook of my frugal meal, and it was no interruption
  to conversation to be stirring a hasty-pudding, or watching the rising and maturing of
  a loaf of bread in the ashes, in the meanwhile. But if twenty came and sat in my house
  there was nothing said about dinner, though there might be bread enough for two, more
  than if eating were a forsaken habit; but we naturally practised abstinence; and this
  was never felt to be an offence against hospitality, but the most proper and
  considerate course. The waste and decay of physical life, which so often needs repair,
  seemed miraculously retarded in such a case, and the vital vigor stood its ground. I
  could entertain thus a thousand as well as twenty; and if any ever went away
  disappointed or hungry from my house when they found me at home, they may depend upon
  it that I sympathized with them at least. So easy is it, though many housekeepers doubt
  it, to establish new and better customs in the place of the old. You need not rest your
  reputation on the dinners you give. For my own part, I was never so effectually
  deterred from frequenting a man's house, by any kind of Cerberus whatever, as by the
  parade one made about dining me, which I took to be a very polite and roundabout hint
  never to trouble him so again. I think I shall never revisit those scenes. I should be
  proud to have for the motto of my cabin those lines of Spenser which one of my visitors
  inscribed on a yellow walnut leaf for a card:&#8212;</p>
  <pre>       "Arriv&#232;d there, the little house they fill,
           Ne looke for entertainment where none was;
        Rest is their feast, and all things at their will:
           The noblest mind the best contentment has."
</pre>

  <p class="nind">When Winslow, afterward governor of the Plymouth Colony, went with a
  companion on a visit of ceremony to Massasoit on foot through the woods, and arrived
  tired and hungry at his lodge, they were well received by the king, but nothing was
  said about eating that day. When the night arrived, to quote their own words&#8212;"He
  laid us on the bed with himself and his wife, they at the one end and we at the other,
  it being only planks laid a foot from the ground and a thin mat upon them. Two more of
  his chief men, for want of room, pressed by and upon us; so that we were worse weary of
  our lodging than of our journey." At one o'clock the next day Massasoit "brought two
  fishes that he had shot," about thrice as big as a bream. "These being boiled, there
  were at least forty looked for a share in them; the most eat of them. This meal only we
  had in two nights and a day; and had not one of us bought a partridge, we had taken our
  journey fasting." Fearing that they would be light-headed for want of food and also
  sleep, owing to "the savages' barbarous singing, (for they use to sing themselves
  asleep,)" and that they might get home while they had strength to travel, they
  departed. As for lodging, it is true they were but poorly entertained, though what they
  found an inconvenience was no doubt intended for an honor; but as far as eating was
  concerned, I do not see how the Indians could have done better. They had nothing to eat
  themselves, and they were wiser than to think that apologies could supply the place of
  food to their guests; so they drew their belts tighter and said nothing about it.
  Another time when Winslow visited them, it being a season of plenty with them, there
  was no deficiency in this respect.</p>

  <p>As for men, they will hardly fail one anywhere. I had more visitors while I lived in
  the woods than at any other period in my life; I mean that I had some. I met several
  there under more favorable circumstances than I could anywhere else. But fewer came to
  see me on trivial business. In this respect, my company was winnowed by my mere
  distance from town. I had withdrawn so far within the great ocean of solitude, into
  which the rivers of society empty, that for the most part, so far as my needs were
  concerned, only the finest sediment was deposited around me. Beside, there were wafted
  to me evidences of unexplored and uncultivated continents on the other side.</p>

  <p>Who should come to my lodge this morning but a true Homeric or Paphlagonian
  man&#8212;he had so suitable and poetic a name that I am sorry I cannot print it
  here&#8212;a Canadian, a woodchopper and post-maker, who can hole fifty posts in a day,
  who made his last supper on a woodchuck which his dog caught. He, too, has heard of
  Homer, and, "if it were not for books," would "not know what to do rainy days," though
  perhaps he has not read one wholly through for many rainy seasons. Some priest who
  could pronounce the Greek itself taught him to read his verse in the Testament in his
  native parish far away; and now I must translate to him, while he holds the book,
  Achilles' reproof to Patroclus for his sad countenance.&#8212;"Why are you in tears,
  Patroclus, like a young girl?"&#8212;</p>
  <pre>      "Or have you alone heard some news from Phthia?
       They say that Menoetius lives yet, son of Actor,
       And Peleus lives, son of &#198;acus, among the Myrmidons,
       Either of whom having died, we should greatly grieve."
</pre>

  <p class="nind">He says, "That's good." He has a great bundle of white oak bark under
  his arm for a sick man, gathered this Sunday morning. "I suppose there's no harm in
  going after such a thing to-day," says he. To him Homer was a great writer, though what
  his writing was about he did not know. A more simple and natural man it would be hard
  to find. Vice and disease, which cast such a sombre moral hue over the world, seemed to
  have hardly any existence for him. He was about twenty-eight years old, and had left
  Canada and his father's house a dozen years before to work in the States, and earn
  money to buy a farm with at last, perhaps in his native country. He was cast in the
  coarsest mould; a stout but sluggish body, yet gracefully carried, with a thick
  sunburnt neck, dark bushy hair, and dull sleepy blue eyes, which were occasionally lit
  up with expression. He wore a flat gray cloth cap, a dingy wool-colored greatcoat, and
  cowhide boots. He was a great consumer of meat, usually carrying his dinner to his work
  a couple of miles past my house&#8212;for he chopped all summer&#8212;in a tin pail;
  cold meats, often cold woodchucks, and coffee in a stone bottle which dangled by a
  string from his belt; and sometimes he offered me a drink. He came along early,
  crossing my bean-field, though without anxiety or haste to get to his work, such as
  Yankees exhibit. He wasn't a-going to hurt himself. He didn't care if he only earned
  his board. Frequently he would leave his dinner in the bushes, when his dog had caught
  a woodchuck by the way, and go back a mile and a half to dress it and leave it in the
  cellar of the house where he boarded, after deliberating first for half an hour whether
  he could not sink it in the pond safely till nightfall&#8212;loving to dwell long upon
  these themes. He would say, as he went by in the morning, "How thick the pigeons are!
  If working every day were not my trade, I could get all the meat I should want by
  hunting-pigeons, woodchucks, rabbits, partridges&#8212;by gosh! I could get all I
  should want for a week in one day."</p>

  <p>He was a skilful chopper, and indulged in some flourishes and ornaments in his art.
  He cut his trees level and close to the ground, that the sprouts which came up
  afterward might be more vigorous and a sled might slide over the stumps; and instead of
  leaving a whole tree to support his corded wood, he would pare it away to a slender
  stake or splinter which you could break off with your hand at last.</p>

  <p>He interested me because he was so quiet and solitary and so happy withal; a well of
  good humor and contentment which overflowed at his eyes. His mirth was without alloy.
  Sometimes I saw him at his work in the woods, felling trees, and he would greet me with
  a laugh of inexpressible satisfaction, and a salutation in Canadian French, though he
  spoke English as well. When I approached him he would suspend his work, and with
  half-suppressed mirth lie along the trunk of a pine which he had felled, and, peeling
  off the inner bark, roll it up into a ball and chew it while he laughed and talked.
  Such an exuberance of animal spirits had he that he sometimes tumbled down and rolled
  on the ground with laughter at anything which made him think and tickled him. Looking
  round upon the trees he would exclaim&#8212;"By George! I can enjoy myself well enough
  here chopping; I want no better sport." Sometimes, when at leisure, he amused himself
  all day in the woods with a pocket pistol, firing salutes to himself at regular
  intervals as he walked. In the winter he had a fire by which at noon he warmed his
  coffee in a kettle; and as he sat on a log to eat his dinner the chickadees would
  sometimes come round and alight on his arm and peck at the potato in his fingers; and
  he said that he "liked to have the little <i>fellers</i> about him."</p>

  <p>In him the animal man chiefly was developed. In physical endurance and contentment
  he was cousin to the pine and the rock. I asked him once if he was not sometimes tired
  at night, after working all day; and he answered, with a sincere and serious look,
  "Gorrappit, I never was tired in my life." But the intellectual and what is called
  spiritual man in him were slumbering as in an infant. He had been instructed only in
  that innocent and ineffectual way in which the Catholic priests teach the aborigines,
  by which the pupil is never educated to the degree of consciousness, but only to the
  degree of trust and reverence, and a child is not made a man, but kept a child. When
  Nature made him, she gave him a strong body and contentment for his portion, and
  propped him on every side with reverence and reliance, that he might live out his
  threescore years and ten a child. He was so genuine and unsophisticated that no
  introduction would serve to introduce him, more than if you introduced a woodchuck to
  your neighbor. He had got to find him out as you did. He would not play any part. Men
  paid him wages for work, and so helped to feed and clothe him; but he never exchanged
  opinions with them. He was so simply and naturally humble&#8212;if he can be called
  humble who never aspires&#8212;that humility was no distinct quality in him, nor could
  he conceive of it. Wiser men were demigods to him. If you told him that such a one was
  coming, he did as if he thought that anything so grand would expect nothing of himself,
  but take all the responsibility on itself, and let him be forgotten still. He never
  heard the sound of praise. He particularly reverenced the writer and the preacher.
  Their performances were miracles. When I told him that I wrote considerably, he thought
  for a long time that it was merely the handwriting which I meant, for he could write a
  remarkably good hand himself. I sometimes found the name of his native parish
  handsomely written in the snow by the highway, with the proper French accent, and knew
  that he had passed. I asked him if he ever wished to write his thoughts. He said that
  he had read and written letters for those who could not, but he never tried to write
  thoughts&#8212;no, he could not, he could not tell what to put first, it would kill
  him, and then there was spelling to be attended to at the same time!</p>

  <p>I heard that a distinguished wise man and reformer asked him if he did not want the
  world to be changed; but he answered with a chuckle of surprise in his Canadian accent,
  not knowing that the question had ever been entertained before, "No, I like it well
  enough." It would have suggested many things to a philosopher to have dealings with
  him. To a stranger he appeared to know nothing of things in general; yet I sometimes
  saw in him a man whom I had not seen before, and I did not know whether he was as wise
  as Shakespeare or as simply ignorant as a child, whether to suspect him of a fine
  poetic consciousness or of stupidity. A townsman told me that when he met him
  sauntering through the village in his small close-fitting cap, and whistling to
  himself, he reminded him of a prince in disguise.</p>

  <p>His only books were an almanac and an arithmetic, in which last he was considerably
  expert. The former was a sort of cyclopaedia to him, which he supposed to contain an
  abstract of human knowledge, as indeed it does to a considerable extent. I loved to
  sound him on the various reforms of the day, and he never failed to look at them in the
  most simple and practical light. He had never heard of such things before. Could he do
  without factories? I asked. He had worn the home-made Vermont gray, he said, and that
  was good. Could he dispense with tea and coffee? Did this country afford any beverage
  beside water? He had soaked hemlock leaves in water and drank it, and thought that was
  better than water in warm weather. When I asked him if he could do without money, he
  showed the convenience of money in such a way as to suggest and coincide with the most
  philosophical accounts of the origin of this institution, and the very derivation of
  the word <i>pecunia</i>. If an ox were his property, and he wished to get needles and
  thread at the store, he thought it would be inconvenient and impossible soon to go on
  mortgaging some portion of the creature each time to that amount. He could defend many
  institutions better than any philosopher, because, in describing them as they concerned
  him, he gave the true reason for their prevalence, and speculation had not suggested to
  him any other. At another time, hearing Plato's definition of a man&#8212;a biped
  without feathers&#8212;and that one exhibited a cock plucked and called it Plato's man,
  he thought it an important difference that the <i>knees</i> bent the wrong way. He
  would sometimes exclaim, "How I love to talk! By George, I could talk all day!" I asked
  him once, when I had not seen him for many months, if he had got a new idea this
  summer. "Good Lord"&#8212;said he, "a man that has to work as I do, if he does not
  forget the ideas he has had, he will do well. May be the man you hoe with is inclined
  to race; then, by gorry, your mind must be there; you think of weeds." He would
  sometimes ask me first on such occasions, if I had made any improvement. One winter day
  I asked him if he was always satisfied with himself, wishing to suggest a substitute
  within him for the priest without, and some higher motive for living. "Satisfied!" said
  he; "some men are satisfied with one thing, and some with another. One man, perhaps, if
  he has got enough, will be satisfied to sit all day with his back to the fire and his
  belly to the table, by George!" Yet I never, by any manoeuvring, could get him to take
  the spiritual view of things; the highest that he appeared to conceive of was a simple
  expediency, such as you might expect an animal to appreciate; and this, practically, is
  true of most men. If I suggested any improvement in his mode of life, he merely
  answered, without expressing any regret, that it was too late. Yet he thoroughly
  believed in honesty and the like virtues.</p>

  <p>There was a certain positive originality, however slight, to be detected in him, and
  I occasionally observed that he was thinking for himself and expressing his own
  opinion, a phenomenon so rare that I would any day walk ten miles to observe it, and it
  amounted to the re-origination of many of the institutions of society. Though he
  hesitated, and perhaps failed to express himself distinctly, he always had a
  presentable thought behind. Yet his thinking was so primitive and immersed in his
  animal life, that, though more promising than a merely learned man's, it rarely ripened
  to anything which can be reported. He suggested that there might be men of genius in
  the lowest grades of life, however permanently humble and illiterate, who take their
  own view always, or do not pretend to see at all; who are as bottomless even as Walden
  Pond was thought to be, though they may be dark and muddy.</p>

  <p>Many a traveller came out of his way to see me and the inside of my house, and, as
  an excuse for calling, asked for a glass of water. I told them that I drank at the
  pond, and pointed thither, offering to lend them a dipper. Far off as I lived, I was
  not exempted from the annual visitation which occurs, methinks, about the first of
  April, when everybody is on the move; and I had my share of good luck, though there
  were some curious specimens among my visitors. Half-witted men from the almshouse and
  elsewhere came to see me; but I endeavored to make them exercise all the wit they had,
  and make their confessions to me; in such cases making wit the theme of our
  conversation; and so was compensated. Indeed, I found some of them to be wiser than the
  so-called <i>overseers</i> of the poor and selectmen of the town, and thought it was
  time that the tables were turned. With respect to wit, I learned that there was not
  much difference between the half and the whole. One day, in particular, an inoffensive,
  simple-minded pauper, whom with others I had often seen used as fencing stuff, standing
  or sitting on a bushel in the fields to keep cattle and himself from straying, visited
  me, and expressed a wish to live as I did. He told me, with the utmost simplicity and
  truth, quite superior, or rather <i>inferior</i>, to anything that is called humility,
  that he was "deficient in intellect." These were his words. The Lord had made him so,
  yet he supposed the Lord cared as much for him as for another. "I have always been so,"
  said he, "from my childhood; I never had much mind; I was not like other children; I am
  weak in the head. It was the Lord's will, I suppose." And there he was to prove the
  truth of his words. He was a metaphysical puzzle to me. I have rarely met a fellowman
  on such promising ground&#8212;it was so simple and sincere and so true all that he
  said. And, true enough, in proportion as he appeared to humble himself was he exalted.
  I did not know at first but it was the result of a wise policy. It seemed that from
  such a basis of truth and frankness as the poor weak-headed pauper had laid, our
  intercourse might go forward to something better than the intercourse of sages.</p>

  <p>I had some guests from those not reckoned commonly among the town's poor, but who
  should be; who are among the world's poor, at any rate; guests who appeal, not to your
  hospitality, but to your <i>hospitalality</i>; who earnestly wish to be helped, and
  preface their appeal with the information that they are resolved, for one thing, never
  to help themselves. I require of a visitor that he be not actually starving, though he
  may have the very best appetite in the world, however he got it. Objects of charity are
  not guests. Men who did not know when their visit had terminated, though I went about
  my business again, answering them from greater and greater remoteness. Men of almost
  every degree of wit called on me in the migrating season. Some who had more wits than
  they knew what to do with; runaway slaves with plantation manners, who listened from
  time to time, like the fox in the fable, as if they heard the hounds a-baying on their
  track, and looked at me beseechingly, as much as to say,&#8212;</p>
  <pre>           "O Christian, will you send me back?
</pre>

  <p class="nind">One real runaway slave, among the rest, whom I helped to forward toward
  the north star. Men of one idea, like a hen with one chicken, and that a duckling; men
  of a thousand ideas, and unkempt heads, like those hens which are made to take charge
  of a hundred chickens, all in pursuit of one bug, a score of them lost in every
  morning's dew&#8212;and become frizzled and mangy in consequence; men of ideas instead
  of legs, a sort of intellectual centipede that made you crawl all over. One man
  proposed a book in which visitors should write their names, as at the White Mountains;
  but, alas! I have too good a memory to make that necessary.</p>

  <p>I could not but notice some of the peculiarities of my visitors. Girls and boys and
  young women generally seemed glad to be in the woods. They looked in the pond and at
  the flowers, and improved their time. Men of business, even farmers, thought only of
  solitude and employment, and of the great distance at which I dwelt from something or
  other; and though they said that they loved a ramble in the woods occasionally, it was
  obvious that they did not. Restless committed men, whose time was an taken up in
  getting a living or keeping it; ministers who spoke of God as if they enjoyed a
  monopoly of the subject, who could not bear all kinds of opinions; doctors, lawyers,
  uneasy housekeepers who pried into my cupboard and bed when I was out&#8212;how came
  Mrs.&#8212;to know that my sheets were not as clean as hers?&#8212;young men who had
  ceased to be young, and had concluded that it was safest to follow the beaten track of
  the professions&#8212;all these generally said that it was not possible to do so much
  good in my position. Ay! there was the rub. The old and infirm and the timid, of
  whatever age or sex, thought most of sickness, and sudden accident and death; to them
  life seemed full of danger&#8212;what danger is there if you don't think of
  any?&#8212;and they thought that a prudent man would carefully select the safest
  position, where Dr. B. might be on hand at a moment's warning. To them the village was
  literally a <i>com-munity</i>, a league for mutual defence, and you would suppose that
  they would not go a-huckleberrying without a medicine chest. The amount of it is, if a
  man is alive, there is always danger that he may die, though the danger must be allowed
  to be less in proportion as he is dead-and-alive to begin with. A man sits as many
  risks as he runs. Finally, there were the self-styled reformers, the greatest bores of
  all, who thought that I was forever singing,&#8212;</p>
  <pre>       This is the house that I built;
       This is the man that lives in the house that I built;
</pre>

  <p class="nind">but they did not know that the third line was,</p>
  <pre>              These are the folks that worry the man
              That lives in the house that I built.
</pre>

  <p class="nind">I did not fear the hen-harriers, for I kept no chickens; but I feared
  the men-harriers rather.</p>

  <p>I had more cheering visitors than the last. Children come a-berrying, railroad men
  taking a Sunday morning walk in clean shirts, fishermen and hunters, poets and
  philosophers; in short, all honest pilgrims, who came out to the woods for freedom's
  sake, and really left the village behind, I was ready to greet with&#8212;"Welcome,
  Englishmen! welcome, Englishmen!" for I had had communication with that race.</p>

  <h2>The Bean-Field</h2>

  <p>Meanwhile my beans, the length of whose rows, added together, was seven miles
  already planted, were impatient to be hoed, for the earliest had grown considerably
  before the latest were in the ground; indeed they were not easily to be put off. What
  was the meaning of this so steady and self-respecting, this small Herculean labor, I
  knew not. I came to love my rows, my beans, though so many more than I wanted. They
  attached me to the earth, and so I got strength like Antaeus. But why should I raise
  them? Only Heaven knows. This was my curious labor all summer&#8212;to make this
  portion of the earth's surface, which had yielded only cinquefoil, blackberries,
  johnswort, and the like, before, sweet wild fruits and pleasant flowers, produce
  instead this pulse. What shall I learn of beans or beans of me? I cherish them, I hoe
  them, early and late I have an eye to them; and this is my day's work. It is a fine
  broad leaf to look on. My auxiliaries are the dews and rains which water this dry soil,
  and what fertility is in the soil itself, which for the most part is lean and effete.
  My enemies are worms, cool days, and most of all woodchucks. The last have nibbled for
  me a quarter of an acre clean. But what right had I to oust johnswort and the rest, and
  break up their ancient herb garden? Soon, however, the remaining beans will be too
  tough for them, and go forward to meet new foes.</p>

  <p>When I was four years old, as I well remember, I was brought from Boston to this my
  native town, through these very woods and this field, to the pond. It is one of the
  oldest scenes stamped on my memory. And now to-night my flute has waked the echoes over
  that very water. The pines still stand here older than I; or, if some have fallen, I
  have cooked my supper with their stumps, and a new growth is rising all around,
  preparing another aspect for new infant eyes. Almost the same johnswort springs from
  the same perennial root in this pasture, and even I have at length helped to clothe
  that fabulous landscape of my infant dreams, and one of the results of my presence and
  influence is seen in these bean leaves, corn blades, and potato vines.</p>

  <p>I planted about two acres and a half of upland; and as it was only about fifteen
  years since the land was cleared, and I myself had got out two or three cords of
  stumps, I did not give it any manure; but in the course of the summer it appeared by
  the arrowheads which I turned up in hoeing, that an extinct nation had anciently dwelt
  here and planted corn and beans ere white men came to clear the land, and so, to some
  extent, had exhausted the soil for this very crop.</p>

  <p>Before yet any woodchuck or squirrel had run across the road, or the sun had got
  above the shrub oaks, while all the dew was on, though the farmers warned me against
  it&#8212;I would advise you to do all your work if possible while the dew is on&#8212;I
  began to level the ranks of haughty weeds in my bean-field and throw dust upon their
  heads. Early in the morning I worked barefooted, dabbling like a plastic artist in the
  dewy and crumbling sand, but later in the day the sun blistered my feet. There the sun
  lighted me to hoe beans, pacing slowly backward and forward over that yellow gravelly
  upland, between the long green rows, fifteen rods, the one end terminating in a shrub
  oak copse where I could rest in the shade, the other in a blackberry field where the
  green berries deepened their tints by the time I had made another bout. Removing the
  weeds, putting fresh soil about the bean stems, and encouraging this weed which I had
  sown, making the yellow soil express its summer thought in bean leaves and blossoms
  rather than in wormwood and piper and millet grass, making the earth say beans instead
  of grass&#8212;this was my daily work. As I had little aid from horses or cattle, or
  hired men or boys, or improved implements of husbandry, I was much slower, and became
  much more intimate with my beans than usual. But labor of the hands, even when pursued
  to the verge of drudgery, is perhaps never the worst form of idleness. It has a
  constant and imperishable moral, and to the scholar it yields a classic result. A very
  <i>agricola laboriosus</i> was I to travellers bound westward through Lincoln and
  Wayland to nobody knows where; they sitting at their ease in gigs, with elbows on
  knees, and reins loosely hanging in festoons; I the home-staying, laborious native of
  the soil. But soon my homestead was out of their sight and thought. It was the only
  open and cultivated field for a great distance on either side of the road, so they made
  the most of it; and sometimes the man in the field heard more of travellers' gossip and
  comment than was meant for his ear: "Beans so late! peas so late!"&#8212;for I
  continued to plant when others had begun to hoe&#8212;the ministerial husbandman had
  not suspected it. "Corn, my boy, for fodder; corn for fodder." "Does he <i>live</i>
  there?" asks the black bonnet of the gray coat; and the hard-featured farmer reins up
  his grateful dobbin to inquire what you are doing where he sees no manure in the
  furrow, and recommends a little chip dirt, or any little waste stuff, or it may be
  ashes or plaster. But here were two acres and a half of furrows, and only a hoe for
  cart and two hands to draw it&#8212;there being an aversion to other carts and
  horses&#8212;and chip dirt far away. Fellow-travellers as they rattled by compared it
  aloud with the fields which they had passed, so that I came to know how I stood in the
  agricultural world. This was one field not in Mr. Coleman's report. And, by the way,
  who estimates the value of the crop which nature yields in the still wilder fields
  unimproved by man? The crop of <i>English</i> hay is carefully weighed, the moisture
  calculated, the silicates and the potash; but in all dells and pond-holes in the woods
  and pastures and swamps grows a rich and various crop only unreaped by man. Mine was,
  as it were, the connecting link between wild and cultivated fields; as some states are
  civilized, and others half-civilized, and others savage or barbarous, so my field was,
  though not in a bad sense, a half-cultivated field. They were beans cheerfully
  returning to their wild and primitive state that I cultivated, and my hoe played the
  <i>Ranz des Vaches</i> for them.</p>

  <p>Near at hand, upon the topmost spray of a birch, sings the brown thrasher&#8212;or
  red mavis, as some love to call him&#8212;all the morning, glad of your society, that
  would find out another farmer's field if yours were not here. While you are planting
  the seed, he cries&#8212;"Drop it, drop it&#8212;cover it up, cover it up&#8212;pull it
  up, pull it up, pull it up." But this was not corn, and so it was safe from such
  enemies as he. You may wonder what his rigmarole, his amateur Paganini performances on
  one string or on twenty, have to do with your planting, and yet prefer it to leached
  ashes or plaster. It was a cheap sort of top dressing in which I had entire faith.</p>

  <p>As I drew a still fresher soil about the rows with my hoe, I disturbed the ashes of
  unchronicled nations who in primeval years lived under these heavens, and their small
  implements of war and hunting were brought to the light of this modern day. They lay
  mingled with other natural stones, some of which bore the marks of having been burned
  by Indian fires, and some by the sun, and also bits of pottery and glass brought hither
  by the recent cultivators of the soil. When my hoe tinkled against the stones, that
  music echoed to the woods and the sky, and was an accompaniment to my labor which
  yielded an instant and immeasurable crop. It was no longer beans that I hoed, nor I
  that hoed beans; and I remembered with as much pity as pride, if I remembered at all,
  my acquaintances who had gone to the city to attend the oratorios. The nighthawk
  circled overhead in the sunny afternoons&#8212;for I sometimes made a day of
  it&#8212;like a mote in the eye, or in heaven's eye, falling from time to time with a
  swoop and a sound as if the heavens were rent, torn at last to very rags and tatters,
  and yet a seamless cope remained; small imps that fill the air and lay their eggs on
  the ground on bare sand or rocks on the tops of hills, where few have found them;
  graceful and slender like ripples caught up from the pond, as leaves are raised by the
  wind to float in the heavens; such kindredship is in nature. The hawk is aerial brother
  of the wave which he sails over and surveys, those his perfect air-inflated wings
  answering to the elemental unfledged pinions of the sea. Or sometimes I watched a pair
  of hen-hawks circling high in the sky, alternately soaring and descending, approaching,
  and leaving one another, as if they were the embodiment of my own thoughts. Or I was
  attracted by the passage of wild pigeons from this wood to that, with a slight
  quivering winnowing sound and carrier haste; or from under a rotten stump my hoe turned
  up a sluggish portentous and outlandish spotted salamander, a trace of Egypt and the
  Nile, yet our contemporary. When I paused to lean on my hoe, these sounds and sights I
  heard and saw anywhere in the row, a part of the inexhaustible entertainment which the
  country offers.</p>

  <p>On gala days the town fires its great guns, which echo like popguns to these woods,
  and some waifs of martial music occasionally penetrate thus far. To me, away there in
  my bean-field at the other end of the town, the big guns sounded as if a puffball had
  burst; and when there was a military turnout of which I was ignorant, I have sometimes
  had a vague sense all the day of some sort of itching and disease in the horizon, as if
  some eruption would break out there soon, either scarlatina or canker-rash, until at
  length some more favorable puff of wind, making haste over the fields and up the
  Wayland road, brought me information of the "trainers." It seemed by the distant hum as
  if somebody's bees had swarmed, and that the neighbors, according to Virgil's advice,
  by a faint <i>tintinnabulum</i> upon the most sonorous of their domestic utensils, were
  endeavoring to call them down into the hive again. And when the sound died quite away,
  and the hum had ceased, and the most favorable breezes told no tale, I knew that they
  had got the last drone of them all safely into the Middlesex hive, and that now their
  minds were bent on the honey with which it was smeared.</p>

  <p>I felt proud to know that the liberties of Massachusetts and of our fatherland were
  in such safe keeping; and as I turned to my hoeing again I was filled with an
  inexpressible confidence, and pursued my labor cheerfully with a calm trust in the
  future.</p>

  <p>When there were several bands of musicians, it sounded as if all the village was a
  vast bellows and all the buildings expanded and collapsed alternately with a din. But
  sometimes it was a really noble and inspiring strain that reached these woods, and the
  trumpet that sings of fame, and I felt as if I could spit a Mexican with a good
  relish&#8212;for why should we always stand for trifles?&#8212;and looked round for a
  woodchuck or a skunk to exercise my chivalry upon. These martial strains seemed as far
  away as Palestine, and reminded me of a march of crusaders in the horizon, with a
  slight tantivy and tremulous motion of the elm tree tops which overhang the village.
  This was one of the <i>great</i> days; though the sky had from my clearing only the
  same everlastingly great look that it wears daily, and I saw no difference in it.</p>

  <p>It was a singular experience that long acquaintance which I cultivated with beans,
  what with planting, and hoeing, and harvesting, and threshing, and picking over and
  selling them&#8212;the last was the hardest of all&#8212;I might add eating, for I did
  taste. I was determined to know beans. When they were growing, I used to hoe from five
  o'clock in the morning till noon, and commonly spent the rest of the day about other
  affairs. Consider the intimate and curious acquaintance one makes with various kinds of
  weeds&#8212;it will bear some iteration in the account, for there was no little
  iteration in the labor&#8212;disturbing their delicate organizations so ruthlessly, and
  making such invidious distinctions with his hoe, levelling whole ranks of one species,
  and sedulously cultivating another. That's Roman wormwood&#8212;that's
  pigweed&#8212;that's sorrel&#8212;that's piper-grass&#8212;have at him, chop him up,
  turn his roots upward to the sun, don't let him have a fibre in the shade, if you do
  he'll turn himself t' other side up and be as green as a leek in two days. A long war,
  not with cranes, but with weeds, those Trojans who had sun and rain and dews on their
  side. Daily the beans saw me come to their rescue armed with a hoe, and thin the ranks
  of their enemies, filling up the trenches with weedy dead. Many a lusty
  crest&#8212;waving Hector, that towered a whole foot above his crowding comrades, fell
  before my weapon and rolled in the dust.</p>

  <p>Those summer days which some of my contemporaries devoted to the fine arts in Boston
  or Rome, and others to contemplation in India, and others to trade in London or New
  York, I thus, with the other farmers of New England, devoted to husbandry. Not that I
  wanted beans to eat, for I am by nature a Pythagorean, so far as beans are concerned,
  whether they mean porridge or voting, and exchanged them for rice; but, perchance, as
  some must work in fields if only for the sake of tropes and expression, to serve a
  parable-maker one day. It was on the whole a rare amusement, which, continued too long,
  might have become a dissipation. Though I gave them no manure, and did not hoe them all
  once, I hoed them unusually well as far as I went, and was paid for it in the end,
  "there being in truth," as Evelyn says, "no compost or laetation whatsoever comparable
  to this continual motion, repastination, and turning of the mould with the spade." "The
  earth," he adds elsewhere, "especially if fresh, has a certain magnetism in it, by
  which it attracts the salt, power, or virtue (call it either) which gives it life, and
  is the logic of all the labor and stir we keep about it, to sustain us; all dungings
  and other sordid temperings being but the vicars succedaneous to this improvement."
  Moreover, this being one of those "worn-out and exhausted lay fields which enjoy their
  sabbath," had perchance, as Sir Kenelm Digby thinks likely, attracted "vital spirits"
  from the air. I harvested twelve bushels of beans.</p>

  chiefly the expensive experiments of gentlemen farmers, my outgoes were,&#8212;</p>

  <p>This is the result of my experience in raising beans: Plant the common small white
  bush bean about the first of June, in rows three feet by eighteen inches apart, being
  careful to select fresh round and unmixed seed. First look out for worms, and supply
  vacancies by planting anew. Then look out for woodchucks, if it is an exposed place,
  for they will nibble off the earliest tender leaves almost clean as they go; and again,
  when the young tendrils make their appearance, they have notice of it, and will shear
  them off with both buds and young pods, sitting erect like a squirrel. But above all
  harvest as early as possible, if you would escape frosts and have a fair and salable
  crop; you may save much loss by this means.</p>

  <p>This further experience also I gained: I said to myself, I will not plant beans and
  corn with so much industry another summer, but such seeds, if the seed is not lost, as
  sincerity, truth, simplicity, faith, innocence, and the like, and see if they will not
  grow in this soil, even with less toil and manurance, and sustain me, for surely it has
  not been exhausted for these crops. Alas! I said this to myself; but now another summer
  is gone, and another, and another, and I am obliged to say to you, Reader, that the
  seeds which I planted, if indeed they <i>were</i> the seeds of those virtues, were
  wormeaten or had lost their vitality, and so did not come up. Commonly men will only be
  brave as their fathers were brave, or timid. This generation is very sure to plant corn
  and beans each new year precisely as the Indians did centuries ago and taught the first
  settlers to do, as if there were a fate in it. I saw an old man the other day, to my
  astonishment, making the holes with a hoe for the seventieth time at least, and not for
  himself to lie down in! But why should not the New Englander try new adventures, and
  not lay so much stress on his grain, his potato and grass crop, and his
  orchards&#8212;raise other crops than these? Why concern ourselves so much about our
  beans for seed, and not be concerned at all about a new generation of men? We should
  really be fed and cheered if when we met a man we were sure to see that some of the
  qualities which I have named, which we all prize more than those other productions, but
  which are for the most part broadcast and floating in the air, had taken root and grown
  in him. Here comes such a subtile and ineffable quality, for instance, as truth or
  justice, though the slightest amount or new variety of it, along the road. Our
  ambassadors should be instructed to send home such seeds as these, and Congress help to
  distribute them over all the land. We should never stand upon ceremony with sincerity.
  We should never cheat and insult and banish one another by our meanness, if there were
  present the kernel of worth and friendliness. We should not meet thus in haste. Most
  men I do not meet at all, for they seem not to have time; they are busy about their
  beans. We would not deal with a man thus plodding ever, leaning on a hoe or a spade as
  a staff between his work, not as a mushroom, but partially risen out of the earth,
  something more than erect, like swallows alighted and walking on the ground:&#8212;</p>
  <pre>        "And as he spake, his wings would now and then
         Spread, as he meant to fly, then close again&#8212;"
</pre>

  <p class="nind">so that we should suspect that we might be conversing with an angel.
  Bread may not always nourish us; but it always does us good, it even takes stiffness
  out of our joints, and makes us supple and buoyant, when we knew not what ailed us, to
  recognize any generosity in man or Nature, to share any unmixed and heroic joy.</p>

  <p>Ancient poetry and mythology suggest, at least, that husbandry was once a sacred
  art; but it is pursued with irreverent haste and heedlessness by us, our object being
  to have large farms and large crops merely. We have no festival, nor procession, nor
  ceremony, not excepting our cattle-shows and so-called Thanksgivings, by which the
  farmer expresses a sense of the sacredness of his calling, or is reminded of its sacred
  origin. It is the premium and the feast which tempt him. He sacrifices not to Ceres and
  the Terrestrial Jove, but to the infernal Plutus rather. By avarice and selfishness,
  and a grovelling habit, from which none of us is free, of regarding the soil as
  property, or the means of acquiring property chiefly, the landscape is deformed,
  husbandry is degraded with us, and the farmer leads the meanest of lives. He knows
  Nature but as a robber. Cato says that the profits of agriculture are particularly
  pious or just (<i>maximeque pius quaestus</i>), and according to Varro the old Romans
  "called the same earth Mother and Ceres, and thought that they who cultivated it led a
  pious and useful life, and that they alone were left of the race of King Saturn."</p>

  <p>We are wont to forget that the sun looks on our cultivated fields and on the
  prairies and forests without distinction. They all reflect and absorb his rays alike,
  and the former make but a small part of the glorious picture which he beholds in his
  daily course. In his view the earth is all equally cultivated like a garden. Therefore
  we should receive the benefit of his light and heat with a corresponding trust and
  magnanimity. What though I value the seed of these beans, and harvest that in the fall
  of the year? This broad field which I have looked at so long looks not to me as the
  principal cultivator, but away from me to influences more genial to it, which water and
  make it green. These beans have results which are not harvested by me. Do they not grow
  for woodchucks partly? The ear of wheat (in Latin <i>spica</i>, obsoletely
  <i>speca</i>, from <i>spe</i>, hope) should not be the only hope of the husbandman; its
  kernel or grain (<i>granum</i> from <i>gerendo</i>, bearing) is not all that it bears.
  How, then, can our harvest fail? Shall I not rejoice also at the abundance of the weeds
  whose seeds are the granary of the birds? It matters little comparatively whether the
  fields fill the farmer's barns. The true husbandman will cease from anxiety, as the

  <h2>The Village</h2>

  <p>After hoeing, or perhaps reading and writing, in the forenoon, I usually bathed
  again in the pond, swimming across one of its coves for a stint, and washed the dust of
  labor from my person, or smoothed out the last wrinkle which study had made, and for
  the afternoon was absolutely free. Every day or two I strolled to the village to hear
  some of the gossip which is incessantly going on there, circulating either from mouth
  to mouth, or from newspaper to newspaper, and which, taken in homoeopathic doses, was
  really as refreshing in its way as the rustle of leaves and the peeping of frogs. As I
  walked in the woods to see the birds and squirrels, so I walked in the village to see
  the men and boys; instead of the wind among the pines I heard the carts rattle. In one
  direction from my house there was a colony of muskrats in the river meadows; under the
  grove of elms and buttonwoods in the other horizon was a village of busy men, as
  curious to me as if they had been prairie-dogs, each sitting at the mouth of its
  burrow, or running over to a neighbor's to gossip. I went there frequently to observe
  their habits. The village appeared to me a great news room; and on one side, to support
  it, as once at Redding &amp; Company's on State Street, they kept nuts and raisins, or
  salt and meal and other groceries. Some have such a vast appetite for the former
  commodity, that is, the news, and such sound digestive organs, that they can sit
  forever in public avenues without stirring, and let it simmer and whisper through them
  like the Etesian winds, or as if inhaling ether, it only producing numbness and
  insensibility to pain&#8212;otherwise it would often be painful to bear&#8212;without
  affecting the consciousness. I hardly ever failed, when I rambled through the village,
  to see a row of such worthies, either sitting on a ladder sunning themselves, with
  their bodies inclined forward and their eyes glancing along the line this way and that,
  from time to time, with a voluptuous expression, or else leaning against a barn with
  their hands in their pockets, like caryatides, as if to prop it up. They, being
  commonly out of doors, heard whatever was in the wind. These are the coarsest mills, in
  which all gossip is first rudely digested or cracked up before it is emptied into finer
  and more delicate hoppers within doors. I observed that the vitals of the village were
  the grocery, the bar-room, the post-office, and the bank; and, as a necessary part of
  the machinery, they kept a bell, a big gun, and a fire-engine, at convenient places;
  and the houses were so arranged as to make the most of mankind, in lanes and fronting
  one another, so that every traveller had to run the gauntlet, and every man, woman, and
  child might get a lick at him. Of course, those who were stationed nearest to the head
  of the line, where they could most see and be seen, and have the first blow at him,
  paid the highest prices for their places; and the few straggling inhabitants in the
  outskirts, where long gaps in the line began to occur, and the traveller could get over
  walls or turn aside into cow-paths, and so escape, paid a very slight ground or window
  tax. Signs were hung out on all sides to allure him; some to catch him by the appetite,
  as the tavern and victualling cellar; some by the fancy, as the dry goods store and the
  jeweller's; and others by the hair or the feet or the skirts, as the barber, the
  shoemaker, or the tailor. Besides, there was a still more terrible standing invitation
  to call at every one of these houses, and company expected about these times. For the
  most part I escaped wonderfully from these dangers, either by proceeding at once boldly
  and without deliberation to the goal, as is recommended to those who run the gauntlet,
  or by keeping my thoughts on high things, like Orpheus, who, "loudly singing the
  praises of the gods to his lyre, drowned the voices of the Sirens, and kept out of
  danger." Sometimes I bolted suddenly, and nobody could tell my whereabouts, for I did
  not stand much about gracefulness, and never hesitated at a gap in a fence. I was even
  accustomed to make an irruption into some houses, where I was well entertained, and
  after learning the kernels and very last sieveful of news&#8212;what had subsided, the
  prospects of war and peace, and whether the world was likely to hold together much
  longer&#8212;I was let out through the rear avenues, and so escaped to the woods
  again.</p>

  <p>It was very pleasant, when I stayed late in town, to launch myself into the night,
  especially if it was dark and tempestuous, and set sail from some bright village parlor
  or lecture room, with a bag of rye or Indian meal upon my shoulder, for my snug harbor
  in the woods, having made all tight without and withdrawn under hatches with a merry
  crew of thoughts, leaving only my outer man at the helm, or even tying up the helm when
  it was plain sailing. I had many a genial thought by the cabin fire "as I sailed." I
  was never cast away nor distressed in any weather, though I encountered some severe
  storms. It is darker in the woods, even in common nights, than most suppose. I
  frequently had to look up at the opening between the trees above the path in order to
  learn my route, and, where there was no cart-path, to feel with my feet the faint track
  which I had worn, or steer by the known relation of particular trees which I felt with
  my hands, passing between two pines for instance, not more than eighteen inches apart,
  in the midst of the woods, invariably, in the darkest night. Sometimes, after coming
  home thus late in a dark and muggy night, when my feet felt the path which my eyes
  could not see, dreaming and absent-minded all the way, until I was aroused by having to
  raise my hand to lift the latch, I have not been able to recall a single step of my
  walk, and I have thought that perhaps my body would find its way home if its master
  should forsake it, as the hand finds its way to the mouth without assistance. Several
  times, when a visitor chanced to stay into evening, and it proved a dark night, I was
  obliged to conduct him to the cart-path in the rear of the house, and then point out to
  him the direction he was to pursue, and in keeping which he was to be guided rather by
  his feet than his eyes. One very dark night I directed thus on their way two young men
  who had been fishing in the pond. They lived about a mile off through the woods, and
  were quite used to the route. A day or two after one of them told me that they wandered
  about the greater part of the night, close by their own premises, and did not get home
  till toward morning, by which time, as there had been several heavy showers in the
  meanwhile, and the leaves were very wet, they were drenched to their skins. I have
  heard of many going astray even in the village streets, when the darkness was so thick
  that you could cut it with a knife, as the saying is. Some who live in the outskirts,
  having come to town a-shopping in their wagons, have been obliged to put up for the
  night; and gentlemen and ladies making a call have gone half a mile out of their way,
  feeling the sidewalk only with their feet, and not knowing when they turned. It is a
  surprising and memorable, as well as valuable experience, to be lost in the woods any
  time. Often in a snow-storm, even by day, one will come out upon a well-known road and
  yet find it impossible to tell which way leads to the village. Though he knows that he
  has travelled it a thousand times, he cannot recognize a feature in it, but it is as
  strange to him as if it were a road in Siberia. By night, of course, the perplexity is
  infinitely greater. In our most trivial walks, we are constantly, though unconsciously,
  steering like pilots by certain well-known beacons and headlands, and if we go beyond
  our usual course we still carry in our minds the bearing of some neighboring cape; and
  not till we are completely lost, or turned round&#8212;for a man needs only to be
  turned round once with his eyes shut in this world to be lost&#8212;do we appreciate
  the vastness and strangeness of nature. Every man has to learn the points of compass
  again as often as he awakes, whether from sleep or any abstraction. Not till we are
  lost, in other words not till we have lost the world, do we begin to find ourselves,
  and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our relations.</p>

  <p>One afternoon, near the end of the first summer, when I went to the village to get a
  shoe from the cobbler's, I was seized and put into jail, because, as I have elsewhere
  related, I did not pay a tax to, or recognize the authority of, the State which buys
  and sells men, women, and children, like cattle, at the door of its senate-house. I had
  gone down to the woods for other purposes. But, wherever a man goes, men will pursue
  and paw him with their dirty institutions, and, if they can, constrain him to belong to
  their desperate odd-fellow society. It is true, I might have resisted forcibly with
  more or less effect, might have run "amok" against society; but I preferred that
  society should run "amok" against me, it being the desperate party. However, I was
  released the next day, obtained my mended shoe, and returned to the woods in season to
  get my dinner of huckleberries on Fair Haven Hill. I was never molested by any person
  but those who represented the State. I had no lock nor bolt but for the desk which held
  my papers, not even a nail to put over my latch or windows. I never fastened my door
  night or day, though I was to be absent several days; not even when the next fall I
  spent a fortnight in the woods of Maine. And yet my house was more respected than if it
  had been surrounded by a file of soldiers. The tired rambler could rest and warm
  himself by my fire, the literary amuse himself with the few books on my table, or the
  curious, by opening my closet door, see what was left of my dinner, and what prospect I
  had of a supper. Yet, though many people of every class came this way to the pond, I
  suffered no serious inconvenience from these sources, and I never missed anything but
  one small book, a volume of Homer, which perhaps was improperly gilded, and this I
  trust a soldier of our camp has found by this time. I am convinced, that if all men
  were to live as simply as I then did, thieving and robbery would be unknown. These take
  place only in communities where some have got more than is sufficient while others have
  not enough. The Pope's Homers would soon get properly distributed.</p>

  <h2>The Ponds</h2>

  <p>Sometimes, having had a surfeit of human society and gossip, and worn out all my
  village friends, I rambled still farther westward than I habitually dwell, into yet
  more unfrequented parts of the town, "to fresh woods and pastures new," or, while the
  sun was setting, made my supper of huckleberries and blueberries on Fair Haven Hill,
  and laid up a store for several days. The fruits do not yield their true flavor to the
  purchaser of them, nor to him who raises them for the market. There is but one way to
  obtain it, yet few take that way. If you would know the flavor of huckleberries, ask
  the cowboy or the partridge. It is a vulgar error to suppose that you have tasted
  huckleberries who never plucked them. A huckleberry never reaches Boston; they have not
  been known there since they grew on her three hills. The ambrosial and essential part
  of the fruit is lost with the bloom which is rubbed off in the market cart, and they
  become mere provender. As long as Eternal Justice reigns, not one innocent huckleberry
  can be transported thither from the country's hills.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, after my hoeing was done for the day, I joined some impatient
  companion who had been fishing on the pond since morning, as silent and motionless as a
  duck or a floating leaf, and, after practising various kinds of philosophy, had
  concluded commonly, by the time I arrived, that he belonged to the ancient sect of
  C&#339;nobites. There was one older man, an excellent fisher and skilled in all kinds
  of woodcraft, who was pleased to look upon my house as a building erected for the
  convenience of fishermen; and I was equally pleased when he sat in my doorway to
  arrange his lines. Once in a while we sat together on the pond, he at one end of the
  boat, and I at the other; but not many words passed between us, for he had grown deaf
  in his later years, but he occasionally hummed a psalm, which harmonized well enough
  with my philosophy. Our intercourse was thus altogether one of unbroken harmony, far
  more pleasing to remember than if it had been carried on by speech. When, as was
  commonly the case, I had none to commune with, I used to raise the echoes by striking
  with a paddle on the side of my boat, filling the surrounding woods with circling and
  dilating sound, stirring them up as the keeper of a menagerie his wild beasts, until I
  elicited a growl from every wooded vale and hillside.</p>

  <p>In warm evenings I frequently sat in the boat playing the flute, and saw the perch,
  which I seem to have charmed, hovering around me, and the moon travelling over the
  ribbed bottom, which was strewed with the wrecks of the forest. Formerly I had come to
  this pond adventurously, from time to time, in dark summer nights, with a companion,
  and, making a fire close to the water's edge, which we thought attracted the fishes, we
  caught pouts with a bunch of worms strung on a thread, and when we had done, far in the
  night, threw the burning brands high into the air like skyrockets, which, coming down
  into the pond, were quenched with a loud hissing, and we were suddenly groping in total
  darkness. Through this, whistling a tune, we took our way to the haunts of men again.
  But now I had made my home by the shore.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, after staying in a village parlor till the family had all retired, I have
  returned to the woods, and, partly with a view to the next day's dinner, spent the
  hours of midnight fishing from a boat by moonlight, serenaded by owls and foxes, and
  hearing, from time to time, the creaking note of some unknown bird close at hand. These
  experiences were very memorable and valuable to me&#8212;anchored in forty feet of
  water, and twenty or thirty rods from the shore, surrounded sometimes by thousands of
  small perch and shiners, dimpling the surface with their tails in the moonlight, and
  communicating by a long flaxen line with mysterious nocturnal fishes which had their
  dwelling forty feet below, or sometimes dragging sixty feet of line about the pond as I
  drifted in the gentle night breeze, now and then feeling a slight vibration along it,
  indicative of some life prowling about its extremity, of dull uncertain blundering
  purpose there, and slow to make up its mind. At length you slowly raise, pulling hand
  over hand, some horned pout squeaking and squirming to the upper air. It was very
  queer, especially in dark nights, when your thoughts had wandered to vast and
  cosmogonal themes in other spheres, to feel this faint jerk, which came to interrupt
  your dreams and link you to Nature again. It seemed as if I might next cast my line
  upward into the air, as well as downward into this element, which was scarcely more
  dense. Thus I caught two fishes as it were with one hook.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>The scenery of Walden is on a humble scale, and, though very beautiful, does not
  approach to grandeur, nor can it much concern one who has not long frequented it or
  lived by its shore; yet this pond is so remarkable for its depth and purity as to merit
  a particular description. It is a clear and deep green well, half a mile long and a
  mile and three quarters in circumference, and contains about sixty-one and a half
  acres; a perennial spring in the midst of pine and oak woods, without any visible inlet
  or outlet except by the clouds and evaporation. The surrounding hills rise abruptly
  from the water to the height of forty to eighty feet, though on the southeast and east
  they attain to about one hundred and one hundred and fifty feet respectively, within a
  quarter and a third of a mile. They are exclusively woodland. All our Concord waters
  have two colors at least; one when viewed at a distance, and another, more proper,
  close at hand. The first depends more on the light, and follows the sky. In clear
  weather, in summer, they appear blue at a little distance, especially if agitated, and
  at a great distance all appear alike. In stormy weather they are sometimes of a dark
  slate-color. The sea, however, is said to be blue one day and green another without any
  perceptible change in the atmosphere. I have seen our river, when, the landscape being
  covered with snow, both water and ice were almost as green as grass. Some consider blue
  "to be the color of pure water, whether liquid or solid." But, looking directly down
  into our waters from a boat, they are seen to be of very different colors. Walden is
  blue at one time and green at another, even from the same point of view. Lying between
  the earth and the heavens, it partakes of the color of both. Viewed from a hilltop it
  reflects the color of the sky; but near at hand it is of a yellowish tint next the
  shore where you can see the sand, then a light green, which gradually deepens to a
  uniform dark green in the body of the pond. In some lights, viewed even from a hilltop,
  it is of a vivid green next the shore. Some have referred this to the reflection of the
  verdure; but it is equally green there against the railroad sandbank, and in the
  spring, before the leaves are expanded, and it may be simply the result of the
  prevailing blue mixed with the yellow of the sand. Such is the color of its iris. This
  is that portion, also, where in the spring, the ice being warmed by the heat of the sun
  reflected from the bottom, and also transmitted through the earth, melts first and
  forms a narrow canal about the still frozen middle. Like the rest of our waters, when
  much agitated, in clear weather, so that the surface of the waves may reflect the sky
  at the right angle, or because there is more light mixed with it, it appears at a
  little distance of a darker blue than the sky itself; and at such a time, being on its
  surface, and looking with divided vision, so as to see the reflection, I have discerned
  a matchless and indescribable light blue, such as watered or changeable silks and sword
  blades suggest, more cerulean than the sky itself, alternating with the original dark
  green on the opposite sides of the waves, which last appeared but muddy in comparison.
  It is a vitreous greenish blue, as I remember it, like those patches of the winter sky
  seen through cloud vistas in the west before sundown. Yet a single glass of its water
  held up to the light is as colorless as an equal quantity of air. It is well known that
  a large plate of glass will have a green tint, owing, as the makers say, to its "body,"
  but a small piece of the same will be colorless. How large a body of Walden water would
  be required to reflect a green tint I have never proved. The water of our river is
  black or a very dark brown to one looking directly down on it, and, like that of most
  ponds, imparts to the body of one bathing in it a yellowish tinge; but this water is of
  such crystalline purity that the body of the bather appears of an alabaster whiteness,
  still more unnatural, which, as the limbs are magnified and distorted withal, produces
  a monstrous effect, making fit studies for a Michael Angelo.</p>

  <p>The water is so transparent that the bottom can easily be discerned at the depth of
  twenty-five or thirty feet. Paddling over it, you may see, many feet beneath the
  surface, the schools of perch and shiners, perhaps only an inch long, yet the former
  easily distinguished by their transverse bars, and you think that they must be ascetic
  fish that find a subsistence there. Once, in the winter, many years ago, when I had
  been cutting holes through the ice in order to catch pickerel, as I stepped ashore I
  tossed my axe back on to the ice, but, as if some evil genius had directed it, it slid
  four or five rods directly into one of the holes, where the water was twenty-five feet
  deep. Out of curiosity, I lay down on the ice and looked through the hole, until I saw
  the axe a little on one side, standing on its head, with its helve erect and gently
  swaying to and fro with the pulse of the pond; and there it might have stood erect and
  swaying till in the course of time the handle rotted off, if I had not disturbed it.
  Making another hole directly over it with an ice chisel which I had, and cutting down
  the longest birch which I could find in the neighborhood with my knife, I made a
  slip-noose, which I attached to its end, and, letting it down carefully, passed it over
  the knob of the handle, and drew it by a line along the birch, and so pulled the axe
  out again.</p>

  <p>The shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones like paving-stones,
  excepting one or two short sand beaches, and is so steep that in many places a single
  leap will carry you into water over your head; and were it not for its remarkable
  transparency, that would be the last to be seen of its bottom till it rose on the
  opposite side. Some think it is bottomless. It is nowhere muddy, and a casual observer
  would say that there were no weeds at all in it; and of noticeable plants, except in
  the little meadows recently overflowed, which do not properly belong to it, a closer
  scrutiny does not detect a flag nor a bulrush, nor even a lily, yellow or white, but
  only a few small heart-leaves and potamogetons, and perhaps a water-target or two; all
  which however a bather might not perceive; and these plants are clean and bright like
  the element they grow in. The stones extend a rod or two into the water, and then the
  bottom is pure sand, except in the deepest parts, where there is usually a little
  sediment, probably from the decay of the leaves which have been wafted on to it so many
  successive falls, and a bright green weed is brought up on anchors even in
  midwinter.</p>

  <p>We have one other pond just like this, White Pond, in Nine Acre Corner, about two
  and a half miles westerly; but, though I am acquainted with most of the ponds within a
  dozen miles of this centre I do not know a third of this pure and well-like character.
  Successive nations perchance have drank at, admired, and fathomed it, and passed away,
  and still its water is green and pellucid as ever. Not an intermitting spring! Perhaps
  on that spring morning when Adam and Eve were driven out of Eden Walden Pond was
  already in existence, and even then breaking up in a gentle spring rain accompanied
  with mist and a southerly wind, and covered with myriads of ducks and geese, which had
  not heard of the fall, when still such pure lakes sufficed them. Even then it had
  commenced to rise and fall, and had clarified its waters and colored them of the hue
  they now wear, and obtained a patent of Heaven to be the only Walden Pond in the world
  and distiller of celestial dews. Who knows in how many unremembered nations'
  literatures this has been the Castalian Fountain? or what nymphs presided over it in
  the Golden Age? It is a gem of the first water which Concord wears in her coronet.</p>

  <p>Yet perchance the first who came to this well have left some trace of their
  footsteps. I have been surprised to detect encircling the pond, even where a thick wood
  has just been cut down on the shore, a narrow shelf-like path in the steep hillside,
  alternately rising and falling, approaching and receding from the water's edge, as old
  probably as the race of man here, worn by the feet of aboriginal hunters, and still
  from time to time unwittingly trodden by the present occupants of the land. This is
  particularly distinct to one standing on the middle of the pond in winter, just after a
  light snow has fallen, appearing as a clear undulating white line, unobscured by weeds
  and twigs, and very obvious a quarter of a mile off in many places where in summer it
  is hardly distinguishable close at hand. The snow reprints it, as it were, in clear
  white type alto-relievo. The ornamented grounds of villas which will one day be built
  here may still preserve some trace of this.</p>

  <p>The pond rises and falls, but whether regularly or not, and within what period,
  nobody knows, though, as usual, many pretend to know. It is commonly higher in the
  winter and lower in the summer, though not corresponding to the general wet and
  dryness. I can remember when it was a foot or two lower, and also when it was at least
  five feet higher, than when I lived by it. There is a narrow sand-bar running into it,
  with very deep water on one side, on which I helped boil a kettle of chowder, some six
  rods from the main shore, about the year 1824, which it has not been possible to do for
  twenty-five years; and, on the other hand, my friends used to listen with incredulity
  when I told them, that a few years later I was accustomed to fish from a boat in a
  secluded cove in the woods, fifteen rods from the only shore they knew, which place was
  long since converted into a meadow. But the pond has risen steadily for two years, and
  now, in the summer of '52, is just five feet higher than when I lived there, or as high
  as it was thirty years ago, and fishing goes on again in the meadow. This makes a
  difference of level, at the outside, of six or seven feet; and yet the water shed by
  the surrounding hills is insignificant in amount, and this overflow must be referred to
  causes which affect the deep springs. This same summer the pond has begun to fall
  again. It is remarkable that this fluctuation, whether periodical or not, appears thus
  to require many years for its accomplishment. I have observed one rise and a part of
  two falls, and I expect that a dozen or fifteen years hence the water will again be as
  low as I have ever known it. Flint's Pond, a mile eastward, allowing for the
  disturbance occasioned by its inlets and outlets, and the smaller intermediate ponds
  also, sympathize with Walden, and recently attained their greatest height at the same
  time with the latter. The same is true, as far as my observation goes, of White
  Pond.</p>

  <p>This rise and fall of Walden at long intervals serves this use at least; the water
  standing at this great height for a year or more, though it makes it difficult to walk
  round it, kills the shrubs and trees which have sprung up about its edge since the last
  rise&#8212;pitch pines, birches, alders, aspens, and others&#8212;and, falling again,
  leaves an unobstructed shore; for, unlike many ponds and all waters which are subject
  to a daily tide, its shore is cleanest when the water is lowest. On the side of the
  pond next my house a row of pitch pines, fifteen feet high, has been killed and tipped
  over as if by a lever, and thus a stop put to their encroachments; and their size
  indicates how many years have elapsed since the last rise to this height. By this
  fluctuation the pond asserts its title to a shore, and thus the <i>shore</i> is
  <i>shorn</i>, and the trees cannot hold it by right of possession. These are the lips
  of the lake, on which no beard grows. It licks its chaps from time to time. When the
  water is at its height, the alders, willows, and maples send forth a mass of fibrous
  red roots several feet long from all sides of their stems in the water, and to the
  height of three or four feet from the ground, in the effort to maintain themselves; and
  I have known the high blueberry bushes about the shore, which commonly produce no
  fruit, bear an abundant crop under these circumstances.</p>

  <p>Some have been puzzled to tell how the shore became so regularly paved. My townsmen
  have all heard the tradition&#8212;the oldest people tell me that they heard it in
  their youth&#8212;that anciently the Indians were holding a pow-wow upon a hill here,
  which rose as high into the heavens as the pond now sinks deep into the earth, and they
  used much profanity, as the story goes, though this vice is one of which the Indians
  were never guilty, and while they were thus engaged the hill shook and suddenly sank,
  and only one old squaw, named Walden, escaped, and from her the pond was named. It has
  been conjectured that when the hill shook these stones rolled down its side and became
  the present shore. It is very certain, at any rate, that once there was no pond here,
  and now there is one; and this Indian fable does not in any respect conflict with the
  account of that ancient settler whom I have mentioned, who remembers so well when he
  first came here with his divining-rod, saw a thin vapor rising from the sward, and the
  hazel pointed steadily downward, and he concluded to dig a well here. As for the
  stones, many still think that they are hardly to be accounted for by the action of the
  waves on these hills; but I observe that the surrounding hills are remarkably full of
  the same kind of stones, so that they have been obliged to pile them up in walls on
  both sides of the railroad cut nearest the pond; and, moreover, there are most stones
  where the shore is most abrupt; so that, unfortunately, it is no longer a mystery to
  me. I detect the paver. If the name was not derived from that of some English
  locality&#8212;Saffron Walden, for instance&#8212;one might suppose that it was called
  originally <i>Walled-in</i> Pond.</p>

  <p>The pond was my well ready dug. For four months in the year its water is as cold as
  it is pure at all times; and I think that it is then as good as any, if not the best,
  in the town. In the winter, all water which is exposed to the air is colder than
  springs and wells which are protected from it. The temperature of the pond water which
  had stood in the room where I sat from five o'clock in the afternoon till noon the next
  day, the sixth of March, 1846, the thermometer having been up to 65&#176; or 70&#176;
  some of the time, owing partly to the sun on the roof, was 42&#176;, or one degree
  colder than the water of one of the coldest wells in the village just drawn. The
  temperature of the Boiling Spring the same day was 45&#176;, or the warmest of any water
  tried, though it is the coldest that I know of in summer, when, beside, shallow and
  stagnant surface water is not mingled with it. Moreover, in summer, Walden never
  becomes so warm as most water which is exposed to the sun, on account of its depth. In
  the warmest weather I usually placed a pailful in my cellar, where it became cool in
  the night, and remained so during the day; though I also resorted to a spring in the
  neighborhood. It was as good when a week old as the day it was dipped, and had no taste
  of the pump. Whoever camps for a week in summer by the shore of a pond, needs only bury
  a pail of water a few feet deep in the shade of his camp to be independent of the
  luxury of ice.</p>

  <p>There have been caught in Walden pickerel, one weighing seven pounds&#8212;to say
  nothing of another which carried off a reel with great velocity, which the fisherman
  safely set down at eight pounds because he did not see him&#8212;perch and pouts, some
  of each weighing over two pounds, shiners, chivins or roach (<i>Leuciscus
  pulchellus</i>), a very few breams, and a couple of eels, one weighing four
  pounds&#8212;I am thus particular because the weight of a fish is commonly its only
  title to fame, and these are the only eels I have heard of here;&#8212;also, I have a
  faint recollection of a little fish some five inches long, with silvery sides and a
  greenish back, somewhat dace-like in its character, which I mention here chiefly to
  link my facts to fable. Nevertheless, this pond is not very fertile in fish. Its
  pickerel, though not abundant, are its chief boast. I have seen at one time lying on
  the ice pickerel of at least three different kinds: a long and shallow one,
  steel-colored, most like those caught in the river; a bright golden kind, with greenish
  reflections and remarkably deep, which is the most common here; and another,
  golden-colored, and shaped like the last, but peppered on the sides with small dark
  brown or black spots, intermixed with a few faint blood-red ones, very much like a
  trout. The specific name <i>reticulatus</i> would not apply to this; it should be
  <i>guttatus</i> rather. These are all very firm fish, and weigh more than their size
  promises. The shiners, pouts, and perch also, and indeed all the fishes which inhabit
  this pond, are much cleaner, handsomer, and firmer-fleshed than those in the river and
  most other ponds, as the water is purer, and they can easily be distinguished from
  them. Probably many ichthyologists would make new varieties of some of them. There are
  also a clean race of frogs and tortoises, and a few mussels in it; muskrats and minks
  leave their traces about it, and occasionally a travelling mud-turtle visits it.
  Sometimes, when I pushed off my boat in the morning, I disturbed a great mud-turtle
  which had secreted himself under the boat in the night. Ducks and geese frequent it in
  the spring and fall, the white-bellied swallows (<i>Hirundo bicolor</i>) skim over it,
  and the peetweets (<i>Totanus macularius</i>) "teeter" along its stony shores all
  summer. I have sometimes disturbed a fish hawk sitting on a white pine over the water;
  but I doubt if it is ever profaned by the wind of a gull, like Fair Haven. At most, it
  tolerates one annual loon. These are all the animals of consequence which frequent it
  now.</p>

  <p>You may see from a boat, in calm weather, near the sandy eastern shore, where the
  water is eight or ten feet deep, and also in some other parts of the pond, some
  circular heaps half a dozen feet in diameter by a foot in height, consisting of small
  stones less than a hen's egg in size, where all around is bare sand. At first you
  wonder if the Indians could have formed them on the ice for any purpose, and so, when
  the ice melted, they sank to the bottom; but they are too regular and some of them
  plainly too fresh for that. They are similar to those found in rivers; but as there are
  no suckers nor lampreys here, I know not by what fish they could be made. Perhaps they
  are the nests of the chivin. These lend a pleasing mystery to the bottom.</p>

  <p>The shore is irregular enough not to be monotonous. I have in my mind's eye the
  western, indented with deep bays, the bolder northern, and the beautifully scalloped
  southern shore, where successive capes overlap each other and suggest unexplored coves
  between. The forest has never so good a setting, nor is so distinctly beautiful, as
  when seen from the middle of a small lake amid hills which rise from the water's edge;
  for the water in which it is reflected not only makes the best foreground in such a
  case, but, with its winding shore, the most natural and agreeable boundary to it. There
  is no rawness nor imperfection in its edge there, as where the axe has cleared a part,
  or a cultivated field abuts on it. The trees have ample room to expand on the water
  side, and each sends forth its most vigorous branch in that direction. There Nature has
  woven a natural selvage, and the eye rises by just gradations from the low shrubs of
  the shore to the highest trees. There are few traces of man's hand to be seen. The
  water laves the shore as it did a thousand years ago.</p>

  <p>A lake is the landscape's most beautiful and expressive feature. It is earth's eye;
  looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his own nature. The fluviatile
  trees next the shore are the slender eyelashes which fringe it, and the wooded hills
  and cliffs around are its overhanging brows.</p>

  <p>Standing on the smooth sandy beach at the east end of the pond, in a calm September
  afternoon, when a slight haze makes the opposite shore-line indistinct, I have seen
  whence came the expression, "the glassy surface of a lake." When you invert your head,
  it looks like a thread of finest gossamer stretched across the valley, and gleaming
  against the distant pine woods, separating one stratum of the atmosphere from another.
  You would think that you could walk dry under it to the opposite hills, and that the
  swallows which skim over might perch on it. Indeed, they sometimes dive below this
  line, as it were by mistake, and are undeceived. As you look over the pond westward you
  are obliged to employ both your hands to defend your eyes against the reflected as well
  as the true sun, for they are equally bright; and if, between the two, you survey its
  surface critically, it is literally as smooth as glass, except where the skater
  insects, at equal intervals scattered over its whole extent, by their motions in the
  sun produce the finest imaginable sparkle on it, or, perchance, a duck plumes itself,
  or, as I have said, a swallow skims so low as to touch it. It may be that in the
  distance a fish describes an arc of three or four feet in the air, and there is one
  bright flash where it emerges, and another where it strikes the water; sometimes the
  whole silvery arc is revealed; or here and there, perhaps, is a thistle-down floating
  on its surface, which the fishes dart at and so dimple it again. It is like molten
  glass cooled but not congealed, and the few motes in it are pure and beautiful like the
  imperfections in glass. You may often detect a yet smoother and darker water, separated
  from the rest as if by an invisible cobweb, boom of the water nymphs, resting on it.
  From a hilltop you can see a fish leap in almost any part; for not a pickerel or shiner
  picks an insect from this smooth surface but it manifestly disturbs the equilibrium of
  the whole lake. It is wonderful with what elaborateness this simple fact is
  advertised&#8212;this piscine murder will out&#8212;and from my distant perch I
  distinguish the circling undulations when they are half a dozen rods in diameter. You
  can even detect a water-bug (<i>Gyrinus</i>) ceaselessly progressing over the smooth
  surface a quarter of a mile off; for they furrow the water slightly, making a
  conspicuous ripple bounded by two diverging lines, but the skaters glide over it
  without rippling it perceptibly. When the surface is considerably agitated there are no
  skaters nor water-bugs on it, but apparently, in calm days, they leave their havens and
  adventurously glide forth from the shore by short impulses till they completely cover
  it. It is a soothing employment, on one of those fine days in the fall when all the
  warmth of the sun is fully appreciated, to sit on a stump on such a height as this,
  overlooking the pond, and study the dimpling circles which are incessantly inscribed on
  its otherwise invisible surface amid the reflected skies and trees. Over this great
  expanse there is no disturbance but it is thus at once gently smoothed away and
  assuaged, as, when a vase of water is jarred, the trembling circles seek the shore and
  all is smooth again. Not a fish can leap or an insect fall on the pond but it is thus
  reported in circling dimples, in lines of beauty, as it were the constant welling up of
  its fountain, the gentle pulsing of its life, the heaving of its breast. The thrills of
  joy and thrills of pain are undistinguishable. How peaceful the phenomena of the lake!
  Again the works of man shine as in the spring. Ay, every leaf and twig and stone and
  cobweb sparkles now at mid-afternoon as when covered with dew in a spring morning.
  Every motion of an oar or an insect produces a flash of light; and if an oar falls, how
  sweet the echo!</p>

  <p>In such a day, in September or October, Walden is a perfect forest mirror, set round
  with stones as precious to my eye as if fewer or rarer. Nothing so fair, so pure, and
  at the same time so large, as a lake, perchance, lies on the surface of the earth. Sky
  water. It needs no fence. Nations come and go without defiling it. It is a mirror which
  no stone can crack, whose quicksilver will never wear off, whose gilding Nature
  continually repairs; no storms, no dust, can dim its surface ever fresh;&#8212;a mirror
  in which all impurity presented to it sinks, swept and dusted by the sun's hazy
  brush&#8212;this the light dust-cloth&#8212;which retains no breath that is breathed on
  it, but sends its own to float as clouds high above its surface, and be reflected in
  its bosom still.</p>

  <p>A field of water betrays the spirit that is in the air. It is continually receiving
  new life and motion from above. It is intermediate in its nature between land and sky.
  On land only the grass and trees wave, but the water itself is rippled by the wind. I
  see where the breeze dashes across it by the streaks or flakes of light. It is
  remarkable that we can look down on its surface. We shall, perhaps, look down thus on
  the surface of air at length, and mark where a still subtler spirit sweeps over it.</p>

  <p>The skaters and water-bugs finally disappear in the latter part of October, when the
  severe frosts have come; and then and in November, usually, in a calm day, there is
  absolutely nothing to ripple the surface. One November afternoon, in the calm at the
  end of a rain-storm of several days' duration, when the sky was still completely
  overcast and the air was full of mist, I observed that the pond was remarkably smooth,
  so that it was difficult to distinguish its surface; though it no longer reflected the
  bright tints of October, but the sombre November colors of the surrounding hills.
  Though I passed over it as gently as possible, the slight undulations produced by my
  boat extended almost as far as I could see, and gave a ribbed appearance to the
  reflections. But, as I was looking over the surface, I saw here and there at a distance
  a faint glimmer, as if some skater insects which had escaped the frosts might be
  collected there, or, perchance, the surface, being so smooth, betrayed where a spring
  welled up from the bottom. Paddling gently to one of these places, I was surprised to
  find myself surrounded by myriads of small perch, about five inches long, of a rich
  bronze color in the green water, sporting there, and constantly rising to the surface
  and dimpling it, sometimes leaving bubbles on it. In such transparent and seemingly
  bottomless water, reflecting the clouds, I seemed to be floating through the air as in
  a balloon, and their swimming impressed me as a kind of flight or hovering, as if they
  were a compact flock of birds passing just beneath my level on the right or left, their
  fins, like sails, set all around them. There were many such schools in the pond,
  apparently improving the short season before winter would draw an icy shutter over
  their broad skylight, sometimes giving to the surface an appearance as if a slight
  breeze struck it, or a few rain-drops fell there. When I approached carelessly and
  alarmed them, they made a sudden splash and rippling with their tails, as if one had
  struck the water with a brushy bough, and instantly took refuge in the depths. At
  length the wind rose, the mist increased, and the waves began to run, and the perch
  leaped much higher than before, half out of water, a hundred black points, three inches
  long, at once above the surface. Even as late as the fifth of December, one year, I saw
  some dimples on the surface, and thinking it was going to rain hard immediately, the
  air being full of mist, I made haste to take my place at the oars and row homeward;
  already the rain seemed rapidly increasing, though I felt none on my cheek, and I
  anticipated a thorough soaking. But suddenly the dimples ceased, for they were produced
  by the perch, which the noise of my oars had seared into the depths, and I saw their
  schools dimly disappearing; so I spent a dry afternoon after all.</p>

  <p>An old man who used to frequent this pond nearly sixty years ago, when it was dark
  with surrounding forests, tells me that in those days he sometimes saw it all alive
  with ducks and other water-fowl, and that there were many eagles about it. He came here
  a-fishing, and used an old log canoe which he found on the shore. It was made of two
  white pine logs dug out and pinned together, and was cut off square at the ends. It was
  very clumsy, but lasted a great many years before it became water-logged and perhaps
  sank to the bottom. He did not know whose it was; it belonged to the pond. He used to
  make a cable for his anchor of strips of hickory bark tied together. An old man, a
  potter, who lived by the pond before the Revolution, told him once that there was an
  iron chest at the bottom, and that he had seen it. Sometimes it would come floating up
  to the shore; but when you went toward it, it would go back into deep water and
  disappear. I was pleased to hear of the old log canoe, which took the place of an
  Indian one of the same material but more graceful construction, which perchance had
  first been a tree on the bank, and then, as it were, fell into the water, to float
  there for a generation, the most proper vessel for the lake. I remember that when I
  first looked into these depths there were many large trunks to be seen indistinctly
  lying on the bottom, which had either been blown over formerly, or left on the ice at
  the last cutting, when wood was cheaper; but now they have mostly disappeared.</p>

  <p>When I first paddled a boat on Walden, it was completely surrounded by thick and
  lofty pine and oak woods, and in some of its coves grape-vines had run over the trees
  next the water and formed bowers under which a boat could pass. The hills which form
  its shores are so steep, and the woods on them were then so high, that, as you looked
  down from the west end, it had the appearance of an amphitheatre for some land of
  sylvan spectacle. I have spent many an hour, when I was younger, floating over its
  surface as the zephyr willed, having paddled my boat to the middle, and lying on my
  back across the seats, in a summer forenoon, dreaming awake, until I was aroused by the
  boat touching the sand, and I arose to see what shore my fates had impelled me to; days
  when idleness was the most attractive and productive industry. Many a forenoon have I
  stolen away, preferring to spend thus the most valued part of the day; for I was rich,
  if not in money, in sunny hours and summer days, and spent them lavishly; nor do I
  regret that I did not waste more of them in the workshop or the teacher's desk. But
  since I left those shores the woodchoppers have still further laid them waste, and now
  for many a year there will be no more rambling through the aisles of the wood, with
  occasional vistas through which you see the water. My Muse may be excused if she is
  silent henceforth. How can you expect the birds to sing when their groves are cut
  down?</p>

  <p>Now the trunks of trees on the bottom, and the old log canoe, and the dark
  surrounding woods, are gone, and the villagers, who scarcely know where it lies,
  instead of going to the pond to bathe or drink, are thinking to bring its water, which
  should be as sacred as the Ganges at least, to the village in a pipe, to wash their
  dishes with!&#8212;to earn their Walden by the turning of a cock or drawing of a plug!
  That devilish Iron Horse, whose ear-rending neigh is heard throughout the town, has
  muddied the Boiling Spring with his foot, and he it is that has browsed off all the
  woods on Walden shore, that Trojan horse, with a thousand men in his belly, introduced
  by mercenary Greeks! Where is the country's champion, the Moore of Moore Hill, to meet
  him at the Deep Cut and thrust an avenging lance between the ribs of the bloated
  pest?</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, of all the characters I have known, perhaps Walden wears best, and
  best preserves its purity. Many men have been likened to it, but few deserve that
  honor. Though the woodchoppers have laid bare first this shore and then that, and the
  Irish have built their sties by it, and the railroad has infringed on its border, and
  the ice-men have skimmed it once, it is itself unchanged, the same water which my
  youthful eyes fell on; all the change is in me. It has not acquired one permanent
  wrinkle after all its ripples. It is perennially young, and I may stand and see a
  swallow dip apparently to pick an insect from its surface as of yore. It struck me
  again tonight, as if I had not seen it almost daily for more than twenty
  years&#8212;Why, here is Walden, the same woodland lake that I discovered so many years
  ago; where a forest was cut down last winter another is springing up by its shore as
  lustily as ever; the same thought is welling up to its surface that was then; it is the
  same liquid joy and happiness to itself and its Maker, ay, and it may be to me. It is
  the work of a brave man surely, in whom there was no guile! He rounded this water with
  his hand, deepened and clarified it in his thought, and in his will bequeathed it to
  Concord. I see by its face that it is visited by the same reflection; and I can almost
  say, Walden, is it you?</p>
  <pre>              It is no dream of mine,
              To ornament a line;
              I cannot come nearer to God and Heaven
              Than I live to Walden even.
              I am its stony shore,
              And the breeze that passes o'er;
              In the hollow of my hand
              Are its water and its sand,
              And its deepest resort
              Lies high in my thought.
</pre>

  <p>The cars never pause to look at it; yet I fancy that the engineers and firemen and
  brakemen, and those passengers who have a season ticket and see it often, are better
  men for the sight. The engineer does not forget at night, or his nature does not, that
  he has beheld this vision of serenity and purity once at least during the day. Though
  seen but once, it helps to wash out State Street and the engine's soot. One proposes
  that it be called "God's Drop."</p>

  <p>I have said that Walden has no visible inlet nor outlet, but it is on the one hand
  distantly and indirectly related to Flint's Pond, which is more elevated, by a chain of
  small ponds coming from that quarter, and on the other directly and manifestly to
  Concord River, which is lower, by a similar chain of ponds through which in some other
  geological period it may have flowed, and by a little digging, which God forbid, it can
  be made to flow thither again. If by living thus reserved and austere, like a hermit in
  the woods, so long, it has acquired such wonderful purity, who would not regret that
  the comparatively impure waters of Flint's Pond should be mingled with it, or itself
  should ever go to waste its sweetness in the ocean wave?</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>Flint's, or Sandy Pond, in Lincoln, our greatest lake and inland sea, lies about a
  mile east of Walden. It is much larger, being said to contain one hundred and
  ninety-seven acres, and is more fertile in fish; but it is comparatively shallow, and
  not remarkably pure. A walk through the woods thither was often my recreation. It was
  worth the while, if only to feel the wind blow on your cheek freely, and see the waves
  run, and remember the life of mariners. I went a-chestnutting there in the fall, on
  windy days, when the nuts were dropping into the water and were washed to my feet; and
  one day, as I crept along its sedgy shore, the fresh spray blowing in my face, I came
  upon the mouldering wreck of a boat, the sides gone, and hardly more than the
  impression of its flat bottom left amid the rushes; yet its model was sharply defined,
  as if it were a large decayed pad, with its veins. It was as impressive a wreck as one
  could imagine on the seashore, and had as good a moral. It is by this time mere
  vegetable mould and undistinguishable pond shore, through which rushes and flags have
  pushed up. I used to admire the ripple marks on the sandy bottom, at the north end of
  this pond, made firm and hard to the feet of the wader by the pressure of the water,
  and the rushes which grew in Indian file, in waving lines, corresponding to these
  marks, rank behind rank, as if the waves had planted them. There also I have found, in
  considerable quantities, curious balls, composed apparently of fine grass or roots, of
  pipewort perhaps, from half an inch to four inches in diameter, and perfectly
  spherical. These wash back and forth in shallow water on a sandy bottom, and are
  sometimes cast on the shore. They are either solid grass, or have a little sand in the
  middle. At first you would say that they were formed by the action of the waves, like a
  pebble; yet the smallest are made of equally coarse materials, half an inch long, and
  they are produced only at one season of the year. Moreover, the waves, I suspect, do
  not so much construct as wear down a material which has already acquired consistency.
  They preserve their form when dry for an indefinite period.</p>

  <p><i>Flint's Pond!</i> Such is the poverty of our nomenclature. What right had the
  unclean and stupid farmer, whose farm abutted on this sky water, whose shores he has
  ruthlessly laid bare, to give his name to it? Some skin-flint, who loved better the
  reflecting surface of a dollar, or a bright cent, in which he could see his own brazen
  face; who regarded even the wild ducks which settled in it as trespassers; his fingers
  grown into crooked and bony talons from the long habit of grasping harpy-like;&#8212;so
  it is not named for me. I go not there to see him nor to hear of him; who never saw it,
  who never bathed in it, who never loved it, who never protected it, who never spoke a
  good word for it, nor thanked God that He had made it. Rather let it be named from the
  fishes that swim in it, the wild fowl or quadrupeds which frequent it, the wild flowers
  which grow by its shores, or some wild man or child the thread of whose history is
  interwoven with its own; not from him who could show no title to it but the deed which
  a like-minded neighbor or legislature gave him&#8212;him who thought only of its money
  value; whose presence perchance cursed all the shores; who exhausted the land around
  it, and would fain have exhausted the waters within it; who regretted only that it was
  not English hay or cranberry meadow&#8212;there was nothing to redeem it, forsooth, in
  his eyes&#8212;and would have drained and sold it for the mud at its bottom. It did not
  turn his mill, and it was no <i>privilege</i> to him to behold it. I respect not his
  labors, his farm where everything has its price, who would carry the landscape, who
  would carry his God, to market, if he could get anything for him; who goes to market
  <i>for</i> his god as it is; on whose farm nothing grows free, whose fields bear no
  crops, whose meadows no flowers, whose trees no fruits, but dollars; who loves not the
  beauty of his fruits, whose fruits are not ripe for him till they are turned to
  dollars. Give me the poverty that enjoys true wealth. Farmers are respectable and
  interesting to me in proportion as they are poor&#8212;poor farmers. A model farm!
  where the house stands like a fungus in a muckheap, chambers for men, horses, oxen, and
  swine, cleansed and uncleansed, all contiguous to one another! Stocked with men! A
  great grease-spot, redolent of manures and buttermilk! Under a high state of
  cultivation, being manured with the hearts and brains of men! As if you were to raise
  your potatoes in the churchyard! Such is a model farm.</p>

  <p>No, no; if the fairest features of the landscape are to be named after men, let them
  be the noblest and worthiest men alone. Let our lakes receive as true names at least as
  the Icarian Sea, where "still the shore" a "brave attempt resounds."</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>Goose Pond, of small extent, is on my way to Flint's; Fair Haven, an expansion of
  Concord River, said to contain some seventy acres, is a mile southwest; and White Pond,
  of about forty acres, is a mile and a half beyond Fair Haven. This is my lake country.
  These, with Concord River, are my water privileges; and night and day, year in year
  out, they grind such grist as I carry to them.</p>

  <p>Since the wood-cutters, and the railroad, and I myself have profaned Walden, perhaps
  the most attractive, if not the most beautiful, of all our lakes, the gem of the woods,
  is White Pond;&#8212;a poor name from its commonness, whether derived from the
  remarkable purity of its waters or the color of its sands. In these as in other
  respects, however, it is a lesser twin of Walden. They are so much alike that you would
  say they must be connected under ground. It has the same stony shore, and its waters
  are of the same hue. As at Walden, in sultry dog-day weather, looking down through the
  woods on some of its bays which are not so deep but that the reflection from the bottom
  tinges them, its waters are of a misty bluish-green or glaucous color. Many years since
  I used to go there to collect the sand by cartloads, to make sandpaper with, and I have
  continued to visit it ever since. One who frequents it proposes to call it Virid Lake.
  Perhaps it might be called Yellow Pine Lake, from the following circumstance. About
  fifteen years ago you could see the top of a pitch pine, of the kind called yellow pine
  hereabouts, though it is not a distinct species, projecting above the surface in deep
  water, many rods from the shore. It was even supposed by some that the pond had sunk,
  and this was one of the primitive forest that formerly stood there. I find that even so
  long ago as 1792, in a "Topographical Description of the Town of Concord," by one of
  its citizens, in the Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, the author,
  after speaking of Walden and White Ponds, adds, "In the middle of the latter may be
  seen, when the water is very low, a tree which appears as if it grew in the place where
  it now stands, although the roots are fifty feet below the surface of the water; the
  top of this tree is broken off, and at that place measures fourteen inches in
  diameter." In the spring of '49 I talked with the man who lives nearest the pond in
  Sudbury, who told me that it was he who got out this tree ten or fifteen years before.
  As near as he could remember, it stood twelve or fifteen rods from the shore, where the
  water was thirty or forty feet deep. It was in the winter, and he had been getting out
  ice in the forenoon, and had resolved that in the afternoon, with the aid of his
  neighbors, he would take out the old yellow pine. He sawed a channel in the ice toward
  the shore, and hauled it over and along and out on to the ice with oxen; but, before he
  had gone far in his work, he was surprised to find that it was wrong end upward, with
  the stumps of the branches pointing down, and the small end firmly fastened in the
  sandy bottom. It was about a foot in diameter at the big end, and he had expected to
  get a good saw-log, but it was so rotten as to be fit only for fuel, if for that. He
  had some of it in his shed then. There were marks of an axe and of woodpeckers on the
  butt. He thought that it might have been a dead tree on the shore, but was finally
  blown over into the pond, and after the top had become water-logged, while the butt-end
  was still dry and light, had drifted out and sunk wrong end up. His father, eighty
  years old, could not remember when it was not there. Several pretty large logs may
  still be seen lying on the bottom, where, owing to the undulation of the surface, they
  look like huge water snakes in motion.</p>

  <p>This pond has rarely been profaned by a boat, for there is little in it to tempt a
  fisherman. Instead of the white lily, which requires mud, or the common sweet flag, the
  blue flag (<i>Iris versicolor</i>) grows thinly in the pure water, rising from the
  stony bottom all around the shore, where it is visited by hummingbirds in June; and the
  color both of its bluish blades and its flowers and especially their reflections, is in
  singular harmony with the glaucous water.</p>

  <p>White Pond and Walden are great crystals on the surface of the earth, Lakes of
  Light. If they were permanently congealed, and small enough to be clutched, they would,
  perchance, be carried off by slaves, like precious stones, to adorn the heads of
  emperors; but being liquid, and ample, and secured to us and our successors forever, we
  disregard them, and run after the diamond of Kohinoor. They are too pure to have a
  market value; they contain no muck. How much more beautiful than our lives, how much
  more transparent than our characters, are they! We never learned meanness of them. How
  much fairer than the pool before the farmer's door, in which his ducks swim! Hither the
  clean wild ducks come. Nature has no human inhabitant who appreciates her. The birds
  with their plumage and their notes are in harmony with the flowers, but what youth or
  maiden conspires with the wild luxuriant beauty of Nature? She flourishes most alone,

  <h2>Baker Farm</h2>

  <p>Sometimes I rambled to pine groves, standing like temples, or like fleets at sea,
  full-rigged, with wavy boughs, and rippling with light, so soft and green and shady
  that the Druids would have forsaken their oaks to worship in them; or to the cedar wood
  beyond Flint's Pond, where the trees, covered with hoary blue berries, spiring higher
  and higher, are fit to stand before Valhalla, and the creeping juniper covers the
  ground with wreaths full of fruit; or to swamps where the usnea lichen hangs in
  festoons from the white spruce trees, and toadstools, round tables of the swamp gods,
  cover the ground, and more beautiful fungi adorn the stumps, like butterflies or
  shells, vegetable winkles; where the swamp-pink and dogwood grow, the red alderberry
  glows like eyes of imps, the waxwork grooves and crushes the hardest woods in its
  folds, and the wild holly berries make the beholder forget his home with their beauty,
  and he is dazzled and tempted by nameless other wild forbidden fruits, too fair for
  mortal taste. Instead of calling on some scholar, I paid many a visit to particular
  trees, of kinds which are rare in this neighborhood, standing far away in the middle of
  some pasture, or in the depths of a wood or swamp, or on a hilltop; such as the black
  birch, of which we have some handsome specimens two feet in diameter; its cousin, the
  yellow birch, with its loose golden vest, perfumed like the first; the beech, which has
  so neat a bole and beautifully lichen-painted, perfect in all its details, of which,
  excepting scattered specimens, I know but one small grove of sizable trees left in the
  township, supposed by some to have been planted by the pigeons that were once baited
  with beechnuts near by; it is worth the while to see the silver grain sparkle when you
  split this wood; the bass; the hornbeam; the <i>Celtis occidentalis</i>, or false elm,
  of which we have but one well-grown; some taller mast of a pine, a shingle tree, or a
  more perfect hemlock than usual, standing like a pagoda in the midst of the woods; and
  many others I could mention. These were the shrines I visited both summer and
  winter.</p>

  <p>Once it chanced that I stood in the very abutment of a rainbow's arch, which filled
  the lower stratum of the atmosphere, tinging the grass and leaves around, and dazzling
  me as if I looked through colored crystal. It was a lake of rainbow light, in which,
  for a short while, I lived like a dolphin. If it had lasted longer it might have tinged
  my employments and life. As I walked on the railroad causeway, I used to wonder at the
  halo of light around my shadow, and would fain fancy myself one of the elect. One who
  visited me declared that the shadows of some Irishmen before him had no halo about
  them, that it was only natives that were so distinguished. Benvenuto Cellini tells us
  in his memoirs, that, after a certain terrible dream or vision which he had during his
  confinement in the castle of St. Angelo a resplendent light appeared over the shadow of
  his head at morning and evening, whether he was in Italy or France, and it was
  particularly conspicuous when the grass was moist with dew. This was probably the same
  phenomenon to which I have referred, which is especially observed in the morning, but
  also at other times, and even by moonlight. Though a constant one, it is not commonly
  noticed, and, in the case of an excitable imagination like Cellini's, it would be basis
  enough for superstition. Beside, he tells us that he showed it to very few. But are
  they not indeed distinguished who are conscious that they are regarded at all?</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>I set out one afternoon to go a-fishing to Fair Haven, through the woods, to eke out
  my scanty fare of vegetables. My way led through Pleasant Meadow, an adjunct of the
  Baker Farm, that retreat of which a poet has since sung, beginning,&#8212;</p>
  <pre>               "Thy entry is a pleasant field,
                Which some mossy fruit trees yield
                Partly to a ruddy brook,
                By gliding musquash undertook,
                And mercurial trout,
                Darting about."
</pre>

  <p class="nind">I thought of living there before I went to Walden. I "hooked" the
  apples, leaped the brook, and scared the musquash and the trout. It was one of those
  afternoons which seem indefinitely long before one, in which many events may happen, a
  large portion of our natural life, though it was already half spent when I started. By
  the way there came up a shower, which compelled me to stand half an hour under a pine,
  piling boughs over my head, and wearing my handkerchief for a shed; and when at length
  I had made one cast over the pickerelweed, standing up to my middle in water, I found
  myself suddenly in the shadow of a cloud, and the thunder began to rumble with such
  emphasis that I could do no more than listen to it. The gods must be proud, thought I,
  with such forked flashes to rout a poor unarmed fisherman. So I made haste for shelter
  to the nearest hut, which stood half a mile from any road, but so much the nearer to
  the pond, and had long been uninhabited:&#8212;</p>
  <pre>                 "And here a poet builded,
                     In the completed years,
                  For behold a trivial cabin
                     That to destruction steers."
</pre>

  <p class="nind">So the Muse fables. But therein, as I found, dwelt now John Field, an
  Irishman, and his wife, and several children, from the broad-faced boy who assisted his
  father at his work, and now came running by his side from the bog to escape the rain,
  to the wrinkled, sibyl-like, cone-headed infant that sat upon its father's knee as in
  the palaces of nobles, and looked out from its home in the midst of wet and hunger
  inquisitively upon the stranger, with the privilege of infancy, not knowing but it was
  the last of a noble line, and the hope and cynosure of the world, instead of John
  Field's poor starveling brat. There we sat together under that part of the roof which
  leaked the least, while it showered and thundered without. I had sat there many times
  of old before the ship was built that floated his family to America. An honest,
  hard-working, but shiftless man plainly was John Field; and his wife, she too was brave
  to cook so many successive dinners in the recesses of that lofty stove; with round
  greasy face and bare breast, still thinking to improve her condition one day; with the
  never absent mop in one hand, and yet no effects of it visible anywhere. The chickens,
  which had also taken shelter here from the rain, stalked about the room like members of
  the family, too humanized, methought, to roast well. They stood and looked in my eye or
  pecked at my shoe significantly. Meanwhile my host told me his story, how hard he
  worked "bogging" for a neighboring farmer, turning up a meadow with a spade or bog hoe
  at the rate of ten dollars an acre and the use of the land with manure for one year,
  and his little broad-faced son worked cheerfully at his father's side the while, not
  knowing how poor a bargain the latter had made. I tried to help him with my experience,
  telling him that he was one of my nearest neighbors, and that I too, who came a-fishing
  here, and looked like a loafer, was getting my living like himself; that I lived in a
  tight, light, and clean house, which hardly cost more than the annual rent of such a
  ruin as his commonly amounts to; and how, if he chose, he might in a month or two build
  himself a palace of his own; that I did not use tea, nor coffee, nor butter, nor milk,
  nor fresh meat, and so did not have to work to get them; again, as I did not work hard,
  I did not have to eat hard, and it cost me but a trifle for my food; but as he began
  with tea, and coffee, and butter, and milk, and beef, he had to work hard to pay for
  them, and when he had worked hard he had to eat hard again to repair the waste of his
  system&#8212;and so it was as broad as it was long, indeed it was broader than it was
  long, for he was discontented and wasted his life into the bargain; and yet he had
  rated it as a gain in coming to America, that here you could get tea, and coffee, and
  meat every day. But the only true America is that country where you are at liberty to
  pursue such a mode of life as may enable you to do without these, and where the state
  does not endeavor to compel you to sustain the slavery and war and other superfluous
  expenses which directly or indirectly result from the use of such things. For I
  purposely talked to him as if he were a philosopher, or desired to be one. I should be
  glad if all the meadows on the earth were left in a wild state, if that were the
  consequence of men's beginning to redeem themselves. A man will not need to study
  history to find out what is best for his own culture. But alas! the culture of an
  Irishman is an enterprise to be undertaken with a sort of moral bog hoe. I told him,
  that as he worked so hard at bogging, he required thick boots and stout clothing, which
  yet were soon soiled and worn out, but I wore light shoes and thin clothing, which cost
  not half so much, though he might think that I was dressed like a gentleman (which,
  however, was not the case), and in an hour or two, without labor, but as a recreation,
  I could, if I wished, catch as many fish as I should want for two days, or earn enough
  money to support me a week. If he and his family would live simply, they might all go
  a-huckleberrying in the summer for their amusement. John heaved a sigh at this, and his
  wife stared with arms a-kimbo, and both appeared to be wondering if they had capital
  enough to begin such a course with, or arithmetic enough to carry it through. It was
  sailing by dead reckoning to them, and they saw not clearly how to make their port so;
  therefore I suppose they still take life bravely, after their fashion, face to face,
  giving it tooth and nail, not having skill to split its massive columns with any fine
  entering wedge, and rout it in detail;&#8212;thinking to deal with it roughly, as one
  should handle a thistle. But they fight at an overwhelming disadvantage&#8212;living,
  John Field, alas! without arithmetic, and failing so.</p>

  <p>"Do you ever fish?" I asked. "Oh yes, I catch a mess now and then when I am lying
  by; good perch I catch."&#8212;"What's your bait?" "I catch shiners with fishworms, and
  bait the perch with them." "You'd better go now, John," said his wife, with glistening
  and hopeful face; but John demurred.</p>

  <p>The shower was now over, and a rainbow above the eastern woods promised a fair
  evening; so I took my departure. When I had got without I asked for a drink, hoping to
  get a sight of the well bottom, to complete my survey of the premises; but there, alas!
  are shallows and quicksands, and rope broken withal, and bucket irrecoverable.
  Meanwhile the right culinary vessel was selected, water was seemingly distilled, and
  after consultation and long delay passed out to the thirsty one&#8212;not yet suffered
  to cool, not yet to settle. Such gruel sustains life here, I thought; so, shutting my
  eyes, and excluding the motes by a skilfully directed undercurrent, I drank to genuine
  hospitality the heartiest draught I could. I am not squeamish in such cases when
  manners are concerned.</p>

  <p>As I was leaving the Irishman's roof after the rain, bending my steps again to the
  pond, my haste to catch pickerel, wading in retired meadows, in sloughs and bog-holes,
  in forlorn and savage places, appeared for an instant trivial to me who had been sent
  to school and college; but as I ran down the hill toward the reddening west, with the
  rainbow over my shoulder, and some faint tinkling sounds borne to my ear through the
  cleansed air, from I know not what quarter, my Good Genius seemed to say&#8212;Go fish
  and hunt far and wide day by day&#8212;farther and wider&#8212;and rest thee by many
  brooks and hearth-sides without misgiving. Remember thy Creator in the days of thy
  youth. Rise free from care before the dawn, and seek adventures. Let the noon find thee
  by other lakes, and the night overtake thee everywhere at home. There are no larger
  fields than these, no worthier games than may here be played. Grow wild according to
  thy nature, like these sedges and brakes, which will never become English bay. Let the
  thunder rumble; what if it threaten ruin to farmers' crops? That is not its errand to
  thee. Take shelter under the cloud, while they flee to carts and sheds. Let not to get
  a living be thy trade, but thy sport. Enjoy the land, but own it not. Through want of
  enterprise and faith men are where they are, buying and selling, and spending their
  lives like serfs.</p>

  <p>O Baker Farm!</p>

  <p>Before I had reached the pond some fresh impulse had brought out John Field, with
  altered mind, letting go "bogging" ere this sunset. But he, poor man, disturbed only a
  couple of fins while I was catching a fair string, and he said it was his luck; but
  when we changed seats in the boat luck changed seats too. Poor John Field!&#8212;I
  trust he does not read this, unless he will improve by it&#8212;thinking to live by
  some derivative old-country mode in this primitive new country&#8212;to catch perch
  with shiners. It is good bait sometimes, I allow. With his horizon all his own, yet he

  <h2>Higher Laws</h2>

  <p>As I came home through the woods with my string of fish, trailing my pole, it being
  now quite dark, I caught a glimpse of a woodchuck stealing across my path, and felt a
  strange thrill of savage delight, and was strongly tempted to seize and devour him raw;
  not that I was hungry then, except for that wildness which he represented. Once or
  twice, however, while I lived at the pond, I found myself ranging the woods, like a
  half-starved hound, with a strange abandonment, seeking some kind of venison which I
  might devour, and no morsel could have been too savage for me. The wildest scenes had
  become unaccountably familiar. I found in myself, and still find, an instinct toward a
  higher, or, as it is named, spiritual life, as do most men, and another toward a
  primitive rank and savage one, and I reverence them both. I love the wild not less than
  the good. The wildness and adventure that are in fishing still recommended it to me. I
  like sometimes to take rank hold on life and spend my day more as the animals do.
  Perhaps I have owed to this employment and to hunting, when quite young, my closest
  acquaintance with Nature. They early introduce us to and detain us in scenery with
  which otherwise, at that age, we should have little acquaintance. Fishermen, hunters,
  woodchoppers, and others, spending their lives in the fields and woods, in a peculiar
  sense a part of Nature themselves, are often in a more favorable mood for observing
  her, in the intervals of their pursuits, than philosophers or poets even, who approach
  her with expectation. She is not afraid to exhibit herself to them. The traveller on
  the prairie is naturally a hunter, on the head waters of the Missouri and Columbia a
  trapper, and at the Falls of St. Mary a fisherman. He who is only a traveller learns
  things at second-hand and by the halves, and is poor authority. We are most interested
  when science reports what those men already know practically or instinctively, for that
  alone is a true <i>humanity</i>, or account of human experience.</p>

  <p>They mistake who assert that the Yankee has few amusements, because he has not so
  many public holidays, and men and boys do not play so many games as they do in England,
  for here the more primitive but solitary amusements of hunting, fishing, and the like
  have not yet given place to the former. Almost every New England boy among my
  contemporaries shouldered a fowling-piece between the ages of ten and fourteen; and his
  hunting and fishing grounds were not limited, like the preserves of an English
  nobleman, but were more boundless even than those of a savage. No wonder, then, that he
  did not oftener stay to play on the common. But already a change is taking place,
  owing, not to an increased humanity, but to an increased scarcity of game, for perhaps
  the hunter is the greatest friend of the animals hunted, not excepting the Humane
  Society.</p>

  <p>Moreover, when at the pond, I wished sometimes to add fish to my fare for variety. I
  have actually fished from the same kind of necessity that the first fishers did.
  Whatever humanity I might conjure up against it was all factitious, and concerned my
  philosophy more than my feelings. I speak of fishing only now, for I had long felt
  differently about fowling, and sold my gun before I went to the woods. Not that I am
  less humane than others, but I did not perceive that my feelings were much affected. I
  did not pity the fishes nor the worms. This was habit. As for fowling, during the last
  years that I carried a gun my excuse was that I was studying ornithology, and sought
  only new or rare birds. But I confess that I am now inclined to think that there is a
  finer way of studying ornithology than this. It requires so much closer attention to
  the habits of the birds, that, if for that reason only, I have been willing to omit the
  gun. Yet notwithstanding the objection on the score of humanity, I am compelled to
  doubt if equally valuable sports are ever substituted for these; and when some of my
  friends have asked me anxiously about their boys, whether they should let them hunt, I
  have answered, yes&#8212;remembering that it was one of the best parts of my
  education&#8212;<i>make</i> them hunters, though sportsmen only at first, if possible,
  mighty hunters at last, so that they shall not find game large enough for them in this
  or any vegetable wilderness&#8212;hunters as well as fishers of men. Thus far I am of
  the opinion of Chaucer's nun, who</p>
  <pre>                 "yave not of the text a pulled hen
            That saith that hunters ben not holy men."
</pre>

  <p class="nind">There is a period in the history of the individual, as of the race,
  when the hunters are the "best men," as the Algonquins called them. We cannot but pity
  the boy who has never fired a gun; he is no more humane, while his education has been
  sadly neglected. This was my answer with respect to those youths who were bent on this
  pursuit, trusting that they would soon outgrow it. No humane being, past the
  thoughtless age of boyhood, will wantonly murder any creature which holds its life by
  the same tenure that he does. The hare in its extremity cries like a child. I warn you,
  mothers, that my sympathies do not always make the usual phil-<i>anthropic</i>
  distinctions.</p>

  <p>Such is oftenest the young man's introduction to the forest, and the most original
  part of himself. He goes thither at first as a hunter and fisher, until at last, if he
  has the seeds of a better life in him, he distinguishes his proper objects, as a poet
  or naturalist it may be, and leaves the gun and fish-pole behind. The mass of men are
  still and always young in this respect. In some countries a hunting parson is no
  uncommon sight. Such a one might make a good shepherd's dog, but is far from being the
  Good Shepherd. I have been surprised to consider that the only obvious employment,
  except wood-chopping, ice-cutting, or the like business, which ever to my knowledge
  detained at Walden Pond for a whole half-day any of my fellow-citizens, whether fathers
  or children of the town, with just one exception, was fishing. Commonly they did not
  think that they were lucky, or well paid for their time, unless they got a long string
  of fish, though they had the opportunity of seeing the pond all the while. They might
  go there a thousand times before the sediment of fishing would sink to the bottom and
  leave their purpose pure; but no doubt such a clarifying process would be going on all
  the while. The Governor and his Council faintly remember the pond, for they went
  a-fishing there when they were boys; but now they are too old and dignified to go
  a-fishing, and so they know it no more forever. Yet even they expect to go to heaven at
  last. If the legislature regards it, it is chiefly to regulate the number of hooks to
  be used there; but they know nothing about the hook of hooks with which to angle for
  the pond itself, impaling the legislature for a bait. Thus, even in civilized
  communities, the embryo man passes through the hunter stage of development.</p>

  <p>I have found repeatedly, of late years, that I cannot fish without falling a little
  in self-respect. I have tried it again and again. I have skill at it, and, like many of
  my fellows, a certain instinct for it, which revives from time to time, but always when
  I have done I feel that it would have been better if I had not fished. I think that I
  do not mistake. It is a faint intimation, yet so are the first streaks of morning.
  There is unquestionably this instinct in me which belongs to the lower orders of
  creation; yet with every year I am less a fisherman, though without more humanity or
  even wisdom; at present I am no fisherman at all. But I see that if I were to live in a
  wilderness I should again be tempted to become a fisher and hunter in earnest. Beside,
  there is something essentially unclean about this diet and all flesh, and I began to
  see where housework commences, and whence the endeavor, which costs so much, to wear a
  tidy and respectable appearance each day, to keep the house sweet and free from all ill
  odors and sights. Having been my own butcher and scullion and cook, as well as the
  gentleman for whom the dishes were served up, I can speak from an unusually complete
  experience. The practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness; and
  besides, when I had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to
  have fed me essentially. It was insignificant and unnecessary, and cost more than it
  came to. A little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well, with less trouble
  and filth. Like many of my contemporaries, I had rarely for many years used animal
  food, or tea, or coffee, etc.; not so much because of any ill effects which I had
  traced to them, as because they were not agreeable to my imagination. The repugnance to
  animal food is not the effect of experience, but is an instinct. It appeared more
  beautiful to live low and fare hard in many respects; and though I never did so, I went
  far enough to please my imagination. I believe that every man who has ever been earnest
  to preserve his higher or poetic faculties in the best condition has been particularly
  inclined to abstain from animal food, and from much food of any kind. It is a
  significant fact, stated by entomologists&#8212;I find it in Kirby and
  Spence&#8212;that "some insects in their perfect state, though furnished with organs of
  feeding, make no use of them"; and they lay it down as "a general rule, that almost all
  insects in this state eat much less than in that of larv&#230;. The voracious
  caterpillar when transformed into a butterfly... and the gluttonous maggot when become
  a fly" content themselves with a drop or two of honey or some other sweet liquid. The
  abdomen under the wings of the butterfly still represents the larva. This is the tidbit
  which tempts his insectivorous fate. The gross feeder is a man in the larva state; and
  there are whole nations in that condition, nations without fancy or imagination, whose
  vast abdomens betray them.</p>

  <p>It is hard to provide and cook so simple and clean a diet as will not offend the
  imagination; but this, I think, is to be fed when we feed the body; they should both
  sit down at the same table. Yet perhaps this may be done. The fruits eaten temperately
  need not make us ashamed of our appetites, nor interrupt the worthiest pursuits. But
  put an extra condiment into your dish, and it will poison you. It is not worth the
  while to live by rich cookery. Most men would feel shame if caught preparing with their
  own hands precisely such a dinner, whether of animal or vegetable food, as is every day
  prepared for them by others. Yet till this is otherwise we are not civilized, and, if
  gentlemen and ladies, are not true men and women. This certainly suggests what change
  is to be made. It may be vain to ask why the imagination will not be reconciled to
  flesh and fat. I am satisfied that it is not. Is it not a reproach that man is a
  carnivorous animal? True, he can and does live, in a great measure, by preying on other
  animals; but this is a miserable way&#8212;as any one who will go to snaring rabbits,
  or slaughtering lambs, may learn&#8212;and he will be regarded as a benefactor of his
  race who shall teach man to confine himself to a more innocent and wholesome diet.
  Whatever my own practice may be, I have no doubt that it is a part of the destiny of
  the human race, in its gradual improvement, to leave off eating animals, as surely as
  the savage tribes have left off eating each other when they came in contact with the
  more civilized.</p>

  <p>If one listens to the faintest but constant suggestions of his genius, which are
  certainly true, he sees not to what extremes, or even insanity, it may lead him; and
  yet that way, as he grows more resolute and faithful, his road lies. The faintest
  assured objection which one healthy man feels will at length prevail over the arguments
  and customs of mankind. No man ever followed his genius till it misled him. Though the
  result were bodily weakness, yet perhaps no one can say that the consequences were to
  be regretted, for these were a life in conformity to higher principles. If the day and
  the night are such that you greet them with joy, and life emits a fragrance like
  flowers and sweet-scented herbs, is more elastic, more starry, more immortal&#8212;that
  is your success. All nature is your congratulation, and you have cause momentarily to
  bless yourself. The greatest gains and values are farthest from being appreciated. We
  easily come to doubt if they exist. We soon forget them. They are the highest reality.
  Perhaps the facts most astounding and most real are never communicated by man to man.
  The true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and indescribable as the
  tints of morning or evening. It is a little star-dust caught, a segment of the rainbow
  which I have clutched.</p>

  <p>Yet, for my part, I was never unusually squeamish; I could sometimes eat a fried rat
  with a good relish, if it were necessary. I am glad to have drunk water so long, for
  the same reason that I prefer the natural sky to an opium-eater's heaven. I would fain
  keep sober always; and there are infinite degrees of drunkenness. I believe that water
  is the only drink for a wise man; wine is not so noble a liquor; and think of dashing
  the hopes of a morning with a cup of warm coffee, or of an evening with a dish of tea!
  Ah, how low I fall when I am tempted by them! Even music may be intoxicating. Such
  apparently slight causes destroyed Greece and Rome, and will destroy England and
  America. Of all ebriosity, who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he
  breathes? I have found it to be the most serious objection to coarse labors long
  continued, that they compelled me to eat and drink coarsely also. But to tell the
  truth, I find myself at present somewhat less particular in these respects. I carry
  less religion to the table, ask no blessing; not because I am wiser than I was, but, I
  am obliged to confess, because, however much it is to be regretted, with years I have
  grown more coarse and indifferent. Perhaps these questions are entertained only in
  youth, as most believe of poetry. My practice is "nowhere," my opinion is here.
  Nevertheless I am far from regarding myself as one of those privileged ones to whom the
  Ved refers when it says, that "he who has true faith in the Omnipresent Supreme Being
  may eat all that exists," that is, is not bound to inquire what is his food, or who
  prepares it; and even in their case it is to be observed, as a Hindoo commentator has
  remarked, that the Vedant limits this privilege to "the time of distress."</p>

  <p>Who has not sometimes derived an inexpressible satisfaction from his food in which
  appetite had no share? I have been thrilled to think that I owed a mental perception to
  the commonly gross sense of taste, that I have been inspired through the palate, that
  some berries which I had eaten on a hillside had fed my genius. "The soul not being
  mistress of herself," says Thseng-tseu, "one looks, and one does not see; one listens,
  and one does not hear; one eats, and one does not know the savor of food." He who
  distinguishes the true savor of his food can never be a glutton; he who does not cannot
  be otherwise. A puritan may go to his brown-bread crust with as gross an appetite as
  ever an alderman to his turtle. Not that food which entereth into the mouth defileth a
  man, but the appetite with which it is eaten. It is neither the quality nor the
  quantity, but the devotion to sensual savors; when that which is eaten is not a viand
  to sustain our animal, or inspire our spiritual life, but food for the worms that
  possess us. If the hunter has a taste for mud-turtles, muskrats, and other such savage
  tidbits, the fine lady indulges a taste for jelly made of a calf's foot, or for
  sardines from over the sea, and they are even. He goes to the mill-pond, she to her
  preserve-pot. The wonder is how they, how you and I, can live this slimy, beastly life,
  eating and drinking.</p>

  <p>Our whole life is startlingly moral. There is never an instant's truce between
  virtue and vice. Goodness is the only investment that never fails. In the music of the
  harp which trembles round the world it is the insisting on this which thrills us. The
  harp is the travelling patterer for the Universe's Insurance Company, recommending its
  laws, and our little goodness is all the assessment that we pay. Though the youth at
  last grows indifferent, the laws of the universe are not indifferent, but are forever
  on the side of the most sensitive. Listen to every zephyr for some reproof, for it is
  surely there, and he is unfortunate who does not hear it. We cannot touch a string or
  move a stop but the charming moral transfixes us. Many an irksome noise, go a long way
  off, is heard as music, a proud, sweet satire on the meanness of our lives.</p>

  <p>We are conscious of an animal in us, which awakens in proportion as our higher
  nature slumbers. It is reptile and sensual, and perhaps cannot be wholly expelled; like
  the worms which, even in life and health, occupy our bodies. Possibly we may withdraw
  from it, but never change its nature. I fear that it may enjoy a certain health of its
  own; that we may be well, yet not pure. The other day I picked up the lower jaw of a
  hog, with white and sound teeth and tusks, which suggested that there was an animal
  health and vigor distinct from the spiritual. This creature succeeded by other means
  than temperance and purity. "That in which men differ from brute beasts," says Mencius,
  "is a thing very inconsiderable; the common herd lose it very soon; superior men
  preserve it carefully." Who knows what sort of life would result if we had attained to
  purity? If I knew so wise a man as could teach me purity I would go to seek him
  forthwith. "A command over our passions, and over the external senses of the body, and
  good acts, are declared by the Ved to be indispensable in the mind's approximation to
  God." Yet the spirit can for the time pervade and control every member and function of
  the body, and transmute what in form is the grossest sensuality into purity and
  devotion. The generative energy, which, when we are loose, dissipates and makes us
  unclean, when we are continent invigorates and inspires us. Chastity is the flowering
  of man; and what are called Genius, Heroism, Holiness, and the like, are but various
  fruits which succeed it. Man flows at once to God when the channel of purity is open.
  By turns our purity inspires and our impurity casts us down. He is blessed who is
  assured that the animal is dying out in him day by day, and the divine being
  established. Perhaps there is none but has cause for shame on account of the inferior
  and brutish nature to which he is allied. I fear that we are such gods or demigods only
  as fauns and satyrs, the divine allied to beasts, the creatures of appetite, and that,
  to some extent, our very life is our disgrace.&#8212;</p>
  <pre>            "How happy's he who hath due place assigned
             To his beasts and disafforested his mind!
                          . . . . . . .
             Can use this horse, goat, wolf, and ev'ry beast,
             And is not ass himself to all the rest!
             Else man not only is the herd of swine,
             But he's those devils too which did incline
             Them to a headlong rage, and made them worse."
</pre>

  <p>All sensuality is one, though it takes many forms; all purity is one. It is the same
  whether a man eat, or drink, or cohabit, or sleep sensually. They are but one appetite,
  and we only need to see a person do any one of these things to know how great a
  sensualist he is. The impure can neither stand nor sit with purity. When the reptile is
  attacked at one mouth of his burrow, he shows himself at another. If you would be
  chaste, you must be temperate. What is chastity? How shall a man know if he is chaste?
  He shall not know it. We have heard of this virtue, but we know not what it is. We
  speak conformably to the rumor which we have heard. From exertion come wisdom and
  purity; from sloth ignorance and sensuality. In the student sensuality is a sluggish
  habit of mind. An unclean person is universally a slothful one, one who sits by a
  stove, whom the sun shines on prostrate, who reposes without being fatigued. If you
  would avoid uncleanness, and all the sins, work earnestly, though it be at cleaning a
  stable. Nature is hard to be overcome, but she must be overcome. What avails it that
  you are Christian, if you are not purer than the heathen, if you deny yourself no more,
  if you are not more religious? I know of many systems of religion esteemed heathenish
  whose precepts fill the reader with shame, and provoke him to new endeavors, though it
  be to the performance of rites merely.</p>

  <p>I hesitate to say these things, but it is not because of the subject&#8212;I care
  not how obscene my <i>words</i> are&#8212;but because I cannot speak of them without
  betraying my impurity. We discourse freely without shame of one form of sensuality, and
  are silent about another. We are so degraded that we cannot speak simply of the
  necessary functions of human nature. In earlier ages, in some countries, every function
  was reverently spoken of and regulated by law. Nothing was too trivial for the Hindoo
  lawgiver, however offensive it may be to modern taste. He teaches how to eat, drink,
  cohabit, void excrement and urine, and the like, elevating what is mean, and does not
  falsely excuse himself by calling these things trifles.</p>

  <p>Every man is the builder of a temple, called his body, to the god he worships, after
  a style purely his own, nor can he get off by hammering marble instead. We are all
  sculptors and painters, and our material is our own flesh and blood and bones. Any
  nobleness begins at once to refine a man's features, any meanness or sensuality to
  imbrute them.</p>

  <p>John Farmer sat at his door one September evening, after a hard day's work, his mind
  still running on his labor more or less. Having bathed, he sat down to re-create his
  intellectual man. It was a rather cool evening, and some of his neighbors were
  apprehending a frost. He had not attended to the train of his thoughts long when he
  heard some one playing on a flute, and that sound harmonized with his mood. Still he
  thought of his work; but the burden of his thought was, that though this kept running
  in his head, and he found himself planning and contriving it against his will, yet it
  concerned him very little. It was no more than the scurf of his skin, which was
  constantly shuffled off. But the notes of the flute came home to his ears out of a
  different sphere from that he worked in, and suggested work for certain faculties which
  slumbered in him. They gently did away with the street, and the village, and the state
  in which he lived. A voice said to him&#8212;Why do you stay here and live this mean
  moiling life, when a glorious existence is possible for you? Those same stars twinkle
  over other fields than these.&#8212;But how to come out of this condition and actually
  migrate thither? All that he could think of was to practise some new austerity, to let
  his mind descend into his body and redeem it, and treat himself with ever increasing
  respect.</p>

  <h2>Brute Neighbors</h2>

  <p>Sometimes I had a companion in my fishing, who came through the village to my house
  from the other side of the town, and the catching of the dinner was as much a social
  exercise as the eating of it.</p>

  <p><i>Hermit.</i> I wonder what the world is doing now. I have not heard so much as a
  locust over the sweet-fern these three hours. The pigeons are all asleep upon their
  roosts&#8212;no flutter from them. Was that a farmer's noon horn which sounded from
  beyond the woods just now? The hands are coming in to boiled salt beef and cider and
  Indian bread. Why will men worry themselves so? He that does not eat need not work. I
  wonder how much they have reaped. Who would live there where a body can never think for
  the barking of Bose? And oh, the housekeeping! to keep bright the devil's door-knobs,
  and scour his tubs this bright day! Better not keep a house. Say, some hollow tree; and
  then for morning calls and dinner-parties! Only a woodpecker tapping. Oh, they swarm;
  the sun is too warm there; they are born too far into life for me. I have water from
  the spring, and a loaf of brown bread on the shelf.&#8212;Hark! I hear a rustling of
  the leaves. Is it some ill-fed village hound yielding to the instinct of the chase? or
  the lost pig which is said to be in these woods, whose tracks I saw after the rain? It
  comes on apace; my sumachs and sweetbriers tremble.&#8212;Eh, Mr. Poet, is it you? How
  do you like the world to-day?</p>

  <p><i>Poet.</i> See those clouds; how they hang! That's the greatest thing I have seen
  to-day. There's nothing like it in old paintings, nothing like it in foreign
  lands&#8212;unless when we were off the coast of Spain. That's a true Mediterranean
  sky. I thought, as I have my living to get, and have not eaten to-day, that I might go
  a-fishing. That's the true industry for poets. It is the only trade I have learned.
  Come, let's along.</p>

  <p><i>Hermit.</i> I cannot resist. My brown bread will soon be gone. I will go with you
  gladly soon, but I am just concluding a serious meditation. I think that I am near the
  end of it. Leave me alone, then, for a while. But that we may not be delayed, you shall
  be digging the bait meanwhile. Angleworms are rarely to be met with in these parts,
  where the soil was never fattened with manure; the race is nearly extinct. The sport of
  digging the bait is nearly equal to that of catching the fish, when one's appetite is
  not too keen; and this you may have all to yourself today. I would advise you to set in
  the spade down yonder among the ground-nuts, where you see the johnswort waving. I
  think that I may warrant you one worm to every three sods you turn up, if you look well
  in among the roots of the grass, as if you were weeding. Or, if you choose to go
  farther, it will not be unwise, for I have found the increase of fair bait to be very
  nearly as the squares of the distances.</p>

  <p><i>Hermit alone.</i> Let me see; where was I? Methinks I was nearly in this frame of
  mind; the world lay about at this angle. Shall I go to heaven or a-fishing? If I should
  soon bring this meditation to an end, would another so sweet occasion be likely to
  offer? I was as near being resolved into the essence of things as ever I was in my
  life. I fear my thoughts will not come back to me. If it would do any good, I would
  whistle for them. When they make us an offer, is it wise to say, We will think of it?
  My thoughts have left no track, and I cannot find the path again. What was it that I
  was thinking of? It was a very hazy day. I will just try these three sentences of
  Confut-see; they may fetch that state about again. I know not whether it was the dumps
  or a budding ecstasy. Mem. There never is but one opportunity of a kind.</p>

  <p><i>Poet.</i> How now, Hermit, is it too soon? I have got just thirteen whole ones,
  beside several which are imperfect or undersized; but they will do for the smaller fry;
  they do not cover up the hook so much. Those village worms are quite too large; a
  shiner may make a meal off one without finding the skewer.</p>

  <p><i>Hermit.</i> Well, then, let's be off. Shall we to the Concord? There's good sport
  there if the water be not too high.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>Why do precisely these objects which we behold make a world? Why has man just these
  species of animals for his neighbors; as if nothing but a mouse could have filled this
  crevice? I suspect that Pilpay &amp; Co. have put animals to their best use, for they
  are all beasts of burden, in a sense, made to carry some portion of our thoughts.</p>

  <p>The mice which haunted my house were not the common ones, which are said to have
  been introduced into the country, but a wild native kind not found in the village. I
  sent one to a distinguished naturalist, and it interested him much. When I was
  building, one of these had its nest underneath the house, and before I had laid the
  second floor, and swept out the shavings, would come out regularly at lunch time and
  pick up the crumbs at my feet. It probably had never seen a man before; and it soon
  became quite familiar, and would run over my shoes and up my clothes. It could readily
  ascend the sides of the room by short impulses, like a squirrel, which it resembled in
  its motions. At length, as I leaned with my elbow on the bench one day, it ran up my
  clothes, and along my sleeve, and round and round the paper which held my dinner, while
  I kept the latter close, and dodged and played at bopeep with it; and when at last I
  held still a piece of cheese between my thumb and finger, it came and nibbled it,
  sitting in my hand, and afterward cleaned its face and paws, like a fly, and walked
  away.</p>

  <p>A ph&#339;be soon built in my shed, and a robin for protection in a pine which grew
  against the house. In June the partridge (<i>Tetrao umbellus</i>), which is so shy a
  bird, led her brood past my windows, from the woods in the rear to the front of my
  house, clucking and calling to them like a hen, and in all her behavior proving herself
  the hen of the woods. The young suddenly disperse on your approach, at a signal from
  the mother, as if a whirlwind had swept them away, and they so exactly resemble the
  dried leaves and twigs that many a traveler has placed his foot in the midst of a
  brood, and heard the whir of the old bird as she flew off, and her anxious calls and
  mewing, or seen her trail her wings to attract his attention, without suspecting their
  neighborhood. The parent will sometimes roll and spin round before you in such a
  dishabille, that you cannot, for a few moments, detect what kind of creature it is. The
  young squat still and flat, often running their heads under a leaf, and mind only their
  mother's directions given from a distance, nor will your approach make them run again
  and betray themselves. You may even tread on them, or have your eyes on them for a
  minute, without discovering them. I have held them in my open hand at such a time, and
  still their only care, obedient to their mother and their instinct, was to squat there
  without fear or trembling. So perfect is this instinct, that once, when I had laid them
  on the leaves again, and one accidentally fell on its side, it was found with the rest
  in exactly the same position ten minutes afterward. They are not callow like the young
  of most birds, but more perfectly developed and precocious even than chickens. The
  remarkably adult yet innocent expression of their open and serene eyes is very
  memorable. All intelligence seems reflected in them. They suggest not merely the purity
  of infancy, but a wisdom clarified by experience. Such an eye was not born when the
  bird was, but is coeval with the sky it reflects. The woods do not yield another such a
  gem. The traveller does not often look into such a limpid well. The ignorant or
  reckless sportsman often shoots the parent at such a time, and leaves these innocents
  to fall a prey to some prowling beast or bird, or gradually mingle with the decaying
  leaves which they so much resemble. It is said that when hatched by a hen they will
  directly disperse on some alarm, and so are lost, for they never hear the mother's call
  which gathers them again. These were my hens and chickens.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable how many creatures live wild and free though secret in the woods,
  and still sustain themselves in the neighborhood of towns, suspected by hunters only.
  How retired the otter manages to live here! He grows to be four feet long, as big as a
  small boy, perhaps without any human being getting a glimpse of him. I formerly saw the
  raccoon in the woods behind where my house is built, and probably still heard their
  whinnering at night. Commonly I rested an hour or two in the shade at noon, after
  planting, and ate my lunch, and read a little by a spring which was the source of a
  swamp and of a brook, oozing from under Brister's Hill, half a mile from my field. The
  approach to this was through a succession of descending grassy hollows, full of young
  pitch pines, into a larger wood about the swamp. There, in a very secluded and shaded
  spot, under a spreading white pine, there was yet a clean, firm sward to sit on. I had
  dug out the spring and made a well of clear gray water, where I could dip up a pailful
  without roiling it, and thither I went for this purpose almost every day in midsummer,
  when the pond was warmest. Thither, too, the woodcock led her brood, to probe the mud
  for worms, flying but a foot above them down the bank, while they ran in a troop
  beneath; but at last, spying me, she would leave her young and circle round and round
  me, nearer and nearer till within four or five feet, pretending broken wings and legs,
  to attract my attention, and get off her young, who would already have taken up their
  march, with faint, wiry peep, single file through the swamp, as she directed. Or I
  heard the peep of the young when I could not see the parent bird. There too the turtle
  doves sat over the spring, or fluttered from bough to bough of the soft white pines
  over my head; or the red squirrel, coursing down the nearest bough, was particularly
  familiar and inquisitive. You only need sit still long enough in some attractive spot
  in the woods that all its inhabitants may exhibit themselves to you by turns.</p>

  <p>I was witness to events of a less peaceful character. One day when I went out to my
  wood-pile, or rather my pile of stumps, I observed two large ants, the one red, the
  other much larger, nearly half an inch long, and black, fiercely contending with one
  another. Having once got hold they never let go, but struggled and wrestled and rolled
  on the chips incessantly. Looking farther, I was surprised to find that the chips were
  covered with such combatants, that it was not a <i>duellum</i>, but a <i>bellum</i>, a
  war between two races of ants, the red always pitted against the black, and frequently
  two red ones to one black. The legions of these Myrmidons covered all the hills and
  vales in my wood-yard, and the ground was already strewn with the dead and dying, both
  red and black. It was the only battle which I have ever witnessed, the only
  battle-field I ever trod while the battle was raging; internecine war; the red
  republicans on the one hand, and the black imperialists on the other. On every side
  they were engaged in deadly combat, yet without any noise that I could hear, and human
  soldiers never fought so resolutely. I watched a couple that were fast locked in each
  other's embraces, in a little sunny valley amid the chips, now at noonday prepared to
  fight till the sun went down, or life went out. The smaller red champion had fastened
  himself like a vice to his adversary's front, and through all the tumblings on that
  field never for an instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near the root, having
  already caused the other to go by the board; while the stronger black one dashed him
  from side to side, and, as I saw on looking nearer, had already divested him of several
  of his members. They fought with more pertinacity than bulldogs. Neither manifested the
  least disposition to retreat. It was evident that their battle-cry was "Conquer or
  die." In the meanwhile there came along a single red ant on the hillside of this
  valley, evidently full of excitement, who either had despatched his foe, or had not yet
  taken part in the battle; probably the latter, for he had lost none of his limbs; whose
  mother had charged him to return with his shield or upon it. Or perchance he was some
  Achilles, who had nourished his wrath apart, and had now come to avenge or rescue his
  Patroclus. He saw this unequal combat from afar&#8212;for the blacks were nearly twice
  the size of the red&#8212;he drew near with rapid pace till he stood on his guard
  within half an inch of the combatants; then, watching his opportunity, he sprang upon
  the black warrior, and commenced his operations near the root of his right fore leg,
  leaving the foe to select among his own members; and so there were three united for
  life, as if a new kind of attraction had been invented which put all other locks and
  cements to shame. I should not have wondered by this time to find that they had their
  respective musical bands stationed on some eminent chip, and playing their national
  airs the while, to excite the slow and cheer the dying combatants. I was myself excited
  somewhat even as if they had been men. The more you think of it, the less the
  difference. And certainly there is not the fight recorded in Concord history, at least,
  if in the history of America, that will bear a moment's comparison with this, whether
  for the numbers engaged in it, or for the patriotism and heroism displayed. For numbers
  and for carnage it was an Austerlitz or Dresden. Concord Fight! Two killed on the
  patriots' side, and Luther Blanchard wounded! Why here every ant was a
  Buttrick&#8212;"Fire! for God's sake fire!"&#8212;and thousands shared the fate of
  Davis and Hosmer. There was not one hireling there. I have no doubt that it was a
  principle they fought for, as much as our ancestors, and not to avoid a three-penny tax
  on their tea; and the results of this battle will be as important and memorable to
  those whom it concerns as those of the battle of Bunker Hill, at least.</p>

  <p>I took up the chip on which the three I have particularly described were struggling,
  carried it into my house, and placed it under a tumbler on my window-sill, in order to
  see the issue. Holding a microscope to the first-mentioned red ant, I saw that, though
  he was assiduously gnawing at the near fore leg of his enemy, having severed his
  remaining feeler, his own breast was all torn away, exposing what vitals he had there
  to the jaws of the black warrior, whose breastplate was apparently too thick for him to
  pierce; and the dark carbuncles of the sufferer's eyes shone with ferocity such as war
  only could excite. They struggled half an hour longer under the tumbler, and when I
  looked again the black soldier had severed the heads of his foes from their bodies, and
  the still living heads were hanging on either side of him like ghastly trophies at his
  saddle-bow, still apparently as firmly fastened as ever, and he was endeavoring with
  feeble struggles, being without feelers and with only the remnant of a leg, and I know
  not how many other wounds, to divest himself of them; which at length, after half an
  hour more, he accomplished. I raised the glass, and he went off over the window-sill in
  that crippled state. Whether he finally survived that combat, and spent the remainder
  of his days in some Hotel des Invalides, I do not know; but I thought that his industry
  would not be worth much thereafter. I never learned which party was victorious, nor the
  cause of the war; but I felt for the rest of that day as if I had had my feelings
  excited and harrowed by witnessing the struggle, the ferocity and carnage, of a human
  battle before my door.</p>

  <p>Kirby and Spence tell us that the battles of ants have long been celebrated and the
  date of them recorded, though they say that Huber is the only modern author who appears
  to have witnessed them. "&#198;neas Sylvius," say they, "after giving a very
  circumstantial account of one contested with great obstinacy by a great and small
  species on the trunk of a pear tree," adds that "this action was fought in the
  pontificate of Eugenius the Fourth, in the presence of Nicholas Pistoriensis, an
  eminent lawyer, who related the whole history of the battle with the greatest
  fidelity." A similar engagement between great and small ants is recorded by Olaus
  Magnus, in which the small ones, being victorious, are said to have buried the bodies
  of their own soldiers, but left those of their giant enemies a prey to the birds. This
  event happened previous to the expulsion of the tyrant Christiern the Second from
  Sweden. The battle which I witnessed took place in the Presidency of Polk, five years
  before the passage of Webster's Fugitive-Slave Bill.</p>

  <p>Many a village Bose, fit only to course a mud-turtle in a victualling cellar,
  sported his heavy quarters in the woods, without the knowledge of his master, and
  ineffectually smelled at old fox burrows and woodchucks' holes; led perchance by some
  slight cur which nimbly threaded the wood, and might still inspire a natural terror in
  its denizens;&#8212;now far behind his guide, barking like a canine bull toward some
  small squirrel which had treed itself for scrutiny, then, cantering off, bending the
  bushes with his weight, imagining that he is on the track of some stray member of the
  jerbilla family. Once I was surprised to see a cat walking along the stony shore of the
  pond, for they rarely wander so far from home. The surprise was mutual. Nevertheless
  the most domestic cat, which has lain on a rug all her days, appears quite at home in
  the woods, and, by her sly and stealthy behavior, proves herself more native there than
  the regular inhabitants. Once, when berrying, I met with a cat with young kittens in
  the woods, quite wild, and they all, like their mother, had their backs up and were
  fiercely spitting at me. A few years before I lived in the woods there was what was
  called a "winged cat" in one of the farm-houses in Lincoln nearest the pond, Mr. Gilian
  Baker's. When I called to see her in June, 1842, she was gone a-hunting in the woods,
  as was her wont (I am not sure whether it was a male or female, and so use the more
  common pronoun), but her mistress told me that she came into the neighborhood a little
  more than a year before, in April, and was finally taken into their house; that she was
  of a dark brownish-gray color, with a white spot on her throat, and white feet, and had
  a large bushy tail like a fox; that in the winter the fur grew thick and flatted out
  along her sides, forming stripes ten or twelve inches long by two and a half wide, and
  under her chin like a muff, the upper side loose, the under matted like felt, and in
  the spring these appendages dropped off. They gave me a pair of her "wings," which I
  keep still. There is no appearance of a membrane about them. Some thought it was part
  flying squirrel or some other wild animal, which is not impossible, for, according to
  naturalists, prolific hybrids have been produced by the union of the marten and
  domestic cat. This would have been the right kind of cat for me to keep, if I had kept
  any; for why should not a poet's cat be winged as well as his horse?</p>

  <p>In the fall the loon (<i>Colymbus glacialis</i>) came, as usual, to moult and bathe
  in the pond, making the woods ring with his wild laughter before I had risen. At rumor
  of his arrival all the Mill-dam sportsmen are on the alert, in gigs and on foot, two by
  two and three by three, with patent rifles and conical balls and spy-glasses. They come
  rustling through the woods like autumn leaves, at least ten men to one loon. Some
  station themselves on this side of the pond, some on that, for the poor bird cannot be
  omnipresent; if he dive here he must come up there. But now the kind October wind
  rises, rustling the leaves and rippling the surface of the water, so that no loon can
  be heard or seen, though his foes sweep the pond with spy-glasses, and make the woods
  resound with their discharges. The waves generously rise and dash angrily, taking sides
  with all water-fowl, and our sportsmen must beat a retreat to town and shop and
  unfinished jobs. But they were too often successful. When I went to get a pail of water
  early in the morning I frequently saw this stately bird sailing out of my cove within a
  few rods. If I endeavored to overtake him in a boat, in order to see how he would
  manoeuvre, he would dive and be completely lost, so that I did not discover him again,
  sometimes, till the latter part of the day. But I was more than a match for him on the
  surface. He commonly went off in a rain.</p>

  <p>As I was paddling along the north shore one very calm October afternoon, for such
  days especially they settle on to the lakes, like the milkweed down, having looked in
  vain over the pond for a loon, suddenly one, sailing out from the shore toward the
  middle a few rods in front of me, set up his wild laugh and betrayed himself. I pursued
  with a paddle and he dived, but when he came up I was nearer than before. He dived
  again, but I miscalculated the direction he would take, and we were fifty rods apart
  when he came to the surface this time, for I had helped to widen the interval; and
  again he laughed long and loud, and with more reason than before. He manoeuvred so
  cunningly that I could not get within half a dozen rods of him. Each time, when he came
  to the surface, turning his head this way and that, he cooly surveyed the water and the
  land, and apparently chose his course so that he might come up where there was the
  widest expanse of water and at the greatest distance from the boat. It was surprising
  how quickly he made up his mind and put his resolve into execution. He led me at once
  to the widest part of the pond, and could not be driven from it. While he was thinking
  one thing in his brain, I was endeavoring to divine his thought in mine. It was a
  pretty game, played on the smooth surface of the pond, a man against a loon. Suddenly
  your adversary's checker disappears beneath the board, and the problem is to place
  yours nearest to where his will appear again. Sometimes he would come up unexpectedly
  on the opposite side of me, having apparently passed directly under the boat. So
  long-winded was he and so unweariable, that when he had swum farthest he would
  immediately plunge again, nevertheless; and then no wit could divine where in the deep
  pond, beneath the smooth surface, he might be speeding his way like a fish, for he had
  time and ability to visit the bottom of the pond in its deepest part. It is said that
  loons have been caught in the New York lakes eighty feet beneath the surface, with
  hooks set for trout&#8212;though Walden is deeper than that. How surprised must the
  fishes be to see this ungainly visitor from another sphere speeding his way amid their
  schools! Yet he appeared to know his course as surely under water as on the surface,
  and swam much faster there. Once or twice I saw a ripple where he approached the
  surface, just put his head out to reconnoitre, and instantly dived again. I found that
  it was as well for me to rest on my oars and wait his reappearing as to endeavor to
  calculate where he would rise; for again and again, when I was straining my eyes over
  the surface one way, I would suddenly be startled by his unearthly laugh behind me. But
  why, after displaying so much cunning, did he invariably betray himself the moment he
  came up by that loud laugh? Did not his white breast enough betray him? He was indeed a
  silly loon, I thought. I could commonly hear the splash of the water when he came up,
  and so also detected him. But after an hour he seemed as fresh as ever, dived as
  willingly, and swam yet farther than at first. It was surprising to see how serenely he
  sailed off with unruffled breast when he came to the surface, doing all the work with
  his webbed feet beneath. His usual note was this demoniac laughter, yet somewhat like
  that of a water-fowl; but occasionally, when he had balked me most successfully and
  come up a long way off, he uttered a long-drawn unearthly howl, probably more like that
  of a wolf than any bird; as when a beast puts his muzzle to the ground and deliberately
  howls. This was his looning&#8212;perhaps the wildest sound that is ever heard here,
  making the woods ring far and wide. I concluded that he laughed in derision of my
  efforts, confident of his own resources. Though the sky was by this time overcast, the
  pond was so smooth that I could see where he broke the surface when I did not hear him.
  His white breast, the stillness of the air, and the smoothness of the water were all
  against him. At length having come up fifty rods off, he uttered one of those prolonged
  howls, as if calling on the god of loons to aid him, and immediately there came a wind
  from the east and rippled the surface, and filled the whole air with misty rain, and I
  was impressed as if it were the prayer of the loon answered, and his god was angry with
  me; and so I left him disappearing far away on the tumultuous surface.</p>

  <p>For hours, in fall days, I watched the ducks cunningly tack and veer and hold the
  middle of the pond, far from the sportsman; tricks which they will have less need to
  practise in Louisiana bayous. When compelled to rise they would sometimes circle round
  and round and over the pond at a considerable height, from which they could easily see
  to other ponds and the river, like black motes in the sky; and, when I thought they had
  gone off thither long since, they would settle down by a slanting flight of a quarter
  of a mile on to a distant part which was left free; but what beside safety they got by
  sailing in the middle of Walden I do not know, unless they love its water for the same
  reason that I do.</p>

  <h2>House-Warming</h2>

  <p>In October I went a-graping to the river meadows, and loaded myself with clusters
  more precious for their beauty and fragrance than for food. There, too, I admired,
  though I did not gather, the cranberries, small waxen gems, pendants of the meadow
  grass, pearly and red, which the farmer plucks with an ugly rake, leaving the smooth
  meadow in a snarl, heedlessly measuring them by the bushel and the dollar only, and
  sells the spoils of the meads to Boston and New York; destined to be <i>jammed</i>, to
  satisfy the tastes of lovers of Nature there. So butchers rake the tongues of bison out
  of the prairie grass, regardless of the torn and drooping plant. The barberry's
  brilliant fruit was likewise food for my eyes merely; but I collected a small store of
  wild apples for coddling, which the proprietor and travellers had overlooked. When
  chestnuts were ripe I laid up half a bushel for winter. It was very exciting at that
  season to roam the then boundless chestnut woods of Lincoln&#8212;they now sleep their
  long sleep under the railroad&#8212;with a bag on my shoulder, and a stick to open burs
  with in my hand, for I did not always wait for the frost, amid the rustling of leaves
  and the loud reproofs of the red squirrels and the jays, whose half-consumed nuts I
  sometimes stole, for the burs which they had selected were sure to contain sound ones.
  Occasionally I climbed and shook the trees. They grew also behind my house, and one
  large tree, which almost overshadowed it, was, when in flower, a bouquet which scented
  the whole neighborhood, but the squirrels and the jays got most of its fruit; the last
  coming in flocks early in the morning and picking the nuts out of the burs before they
  fell, I relinquished these trees to them and visited the more distant woods composed
  wholly of chestnut. These nuts, as far as they went, were a good substitute for bread.
  Many other substitutes might, perhaps, be found. Digging one day for fishworms, I
  discovered the ground-nut (<i>Apios tuberosa</i>) on its string, the potato of the
  aborigines, a sort of fabulous fruit, which I had begun to doubt if I had ever dug and
  eaten in childhood, as I had told, and had not dreamed it. I had often since seen its
  crumpled red velvety blossom supported by the stems of other plants without knowing it
  to be the same. Cultivation has well-nigh exterminated it. It has a sweetish taste,
  much like that of a frost-bitten potato, and I found it better boiled than roasted.
  This tuber seemed like a faint promise of Nature to rear her own children and feed them
  simply here at some future period. In these days of fatted cattle and waving
  grain-fields this humble root, which was once the <i>totem</i> of an Indian tribe, is
  quite forgotten, or known only by its flowering vine; but let wild Nature reign here
  once more, and the tender and luxurious English grains will probably disappear before a
  myriad of foes, and without the care of man the crow may carry back even the last seed
  of corn to the great cornfield of the Indian's God in the southwest, whence he is said
  to have brought it; but the now almost exterminated ground-nut will perhaps revive and
  flourish in spite of frosts and wildness, prove itself indigenous, and resume its
  ancient importance and dignity as the diet of the hunter tribe. Some Indian Ceres or
  Minerva must have been the inventor and bestower of it; and when the reign of poetry
  commences here, its leaves and string of nuts may be represented on our works of
  art.</p>

  <p>Already, by the first of September, I had seen two or three small maples turned
  scarlet across the pond, beneath where the white stems of three aspens diverged, at the
  point of a promontory, next the water. Ah, many a tale their color told! And gradually
  from week to week the character of each tree came out, and it admired itself reflected
  in the smooth mirror of the lake. Each morning the manager of this gallery substituted
  some new picture, distinguished by more brilliant or harmonious coloring, for the old
  upon the walls.</p>

  <p>The wasps came by thousands to my lodge in October, as to winter quarters, and
  settled on my windows within and on the walls overhead, sometimes deterring visitors
  from entering. Each morning, when they were numbed with cold, I swept some of them out,
  but I did not trouble myself much to get rid of them; I even felt complimented by their
  regarding my house as a desirable shelter. They never molested me seriously, though
  they bedded with me; and they gradually disappeared, into what crevices I do not know,
  avoiding winter and unspeakable cold.</p>

  <p>Like the wasps, before I finally went into winter quarters in November, I used to
  resort to the northeast side of Walden, which the sun, reflected from the pitch pine
  woods and the stony shore, made the fireside of the pond; it is so much pleasanter and
  wholesomer to be warmed by the sun while you can be, than by an artificial fire. I thus
  warmed myself by the still glowing embers which the summer, like a departed hunter, had
  left.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>When I came to build my chimney I studied masonry. My bricks, being second-hand
  ones, required to be cleaned with a trowel, so that I learned more than usual of the
  qualities of bricks and trowels. The mortar on them was fifty years old, and was said
  to be still growing harder; but this is one of those sayings which men love to repeat
  whether they are true or not. Such sayings themselves grow harder and adhere more
  firmly with age, and it would take many blows with a trowel to clean an old wiseacre of
  them. Many of the villages of Mesopotamia are built of second-hand bricks of a very
  good quality, obtained from the ruins of Babylon, and the cement on them is older and
  probably harder still. However that may be, I was struck by the peculiar toughness of
  the steel which bore so many violent blows without being worn out. As my bricks had
  been in a chimney before, though I did not read the name of Nebuchadnezzar on them, I
  picked out as many fireplace bricks as I could find, to save work and waste, and I
  filled the spaces between the bricks about the fireplace with stones from the pond
  shore, and also made my mortar with the white sand from the same place. I lingered most
  about the fireplace, as the most vital part of the house. Indeed, I worked so
  deliberately, that though I commenced at the ground in the morning, a course of bricks
  raised a few inches above the floor served for my pillow at night; yet I did not get a
  stiff neck for it that I remember; my stiff neck is of older date. I took a poet to
  board for a fortnight about those times, which caused me to be put to it for room. He
  brought his own knife, though I had two, and we used to scour them by thrusting them
  into the earth. He shared with me the labors of cooking. I was pleased to see my work
  rising so square and solid by degrees, and reflected, that, if it proceeded slowly, it
  was calculated to endure a long time. The chimney is to some extent an independent
  structure, standing on the ground, and rising through the house to the heavens; even
  after the house is burned it still stands sometimes, and its importance and
  independence are apparent. This was toward the end of summer. It was now November.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>The north wind had already begun to cool the pond, though it took many weeks of
  steady blowing to accomplish it, it is so deep. When I began to have a fire at evening,
  before I plastered my house, the chimney carried smoke particularly well, because of
  the numerous chinks between the boards. Yet I passed some cheerful evenings in that
  cool and airy apartment, surrounded by the rough brown boards full of knots, and
  rafters with the bark on high overhead. My house never pleased my eye so much after it
  was plastered, though I was obliged to confess that it was more comfortable. Should not
  every apartment in which man dwells be lofty enough to create some obscurity overhead,
  where flickering shadows may play at evening about the rafters? These forms are more
  agreeable to the fancy and imagination than fresco paintings or other the most
  expensive furniture. I now first began to inhabit my house, I may say, when I began to
  use it for warmth as well as shelter. I had got a couple of old fire-dogs to keep the
  wood from the hearth, and it did me good to see the soot form on the back of the
  chimney which I had built, and I poked the fire with more right and more satisfaction
  than usual. My dwelling was small, and I could hardly entertain an echo in it; but it
  seemed larger for being a single apartment and remote from neighbors. All the
  attractions of a house were concentrated in one room; it was kitchen, chamber, parlor,
  and keeping-room; and whatever satisfaction parent or child, master or servant, derive
  from living in a house, I enjoyed it all. Cato says, the master of a family
  (<i>patremfamilias</i>) must have in his rustic villa "cellam oleariam, vinariam, dolia
  multa, uti lubeat caritatem expectare, et rei, et virtuti, et gloriae erit," that is,
  "an oil and wine cellar, many casks, so that it may be pleasant to expect hard times;
  it will be for his advantage, and virtue, and glory." I had in my cellar a firkin of
  potatoes, about two quarts of peas with the weevil in them, and on my shelf a little
  rice, a jug of molasses, and of rye and Indian meal a peck each.</p>

  <p>I sometimes dream of a larger and more populous house, standing in a golden age, of
  enduring materials, and without gingerbread work, which shall still consist of only one
  room, a vast, rude, substantial, primitive hall, without ceiling or plastering, with
  bare rafters and purlins supporting a sort of lower heaven over one's head&#8212;useful
  to keep off rain and snow, where the king and queen posts stand out to receive your
  homage, when you have done reverence to the prostrate Saturn of an older dynasty on
  stepping over the sill; a cavernous house, wherein you must reach up a torch upon a
  pole to see the roof; where some may live in the fireplace, some in the recess of a
  window, and some on settles, some at one end of the hall, some at another, and some
  aloft on rafters with the spiders, if they choose; a house which you have got into when
  you have opened the outside door, and the ceremony is over; where the weary traveller
  may wash, and eat, and converse, and sleep, without further journey; such a shelter as
  you would be glad to reach in a tempestuous night, containing all the essentials of a
  house, and nothing for house-keeping; where you can see all the treasures of the house
  at one view, and everything hangs upon its peg, that a man should use; at once kitchen,
  pantry, parlor, chamber, storehouse, and garret; where you can see so necessary a
  thing, as a barrel or a ladder, so convenient a thing as a cupboard, and hear the pot
  boil, and pay your respects to the fire that cooks your dinner, and the oven that bakes
  your bread, and the necessary furniture and utensils are the chief ornaments; where the
  washing is not put out, nor the fire, nor the mistress, and perhaps you are sometimes
  requested to move from off the trap-door, when the cook would descend into the cellar,
  and so learn whether the ground is solid or hollow beneath you without stamping. A
  house whose inside is as open and manifest as a bird's nest, and you cannot go in at
  the front door and out at the back without seeing some of its inhabitants; where to be
  a guest is to be presented with the freedom of the house, and not to be carefully
  excluded from seven eighths of it, shut up in a particular cell, and told to make
  yourself at home there&#8212;in solitary confinement. Nowadays the host does not admit
  you to <i>his</i> hearth, but has got the mason to build one for yourself somewhere in
  his alley, and hospitality is the art of <i>keeping</i> you at the greatest distance.
  There is as much secrecy about the cooking as if he had a design to poison you. I am
  aware that I have been on many a man's premises, and might have been legally ordered
  off, but I am not aware that I have been in many men's houses. I might visit in my old
  clothes a king and queen who lived simply in such a house as I have described, if I
  were going their way; but backing out of a modern palace will be all that I shall
  desire to learn, if ever I am caught in one.</p>

  <p>It would seem as if the very language of our parlors would lose all its nerve and
  degenerate into <i>palaver</i> wholly, our lives pass at such remoteness from its
  symbols, and its metaphors and tropes are necessarily so far fetched, through slides
  and dumb-waiters, as it were; in other words, the parlor is so far from the kitchen and
  workshop. The dinner even is only the parable of a dinner, commonly. As if only the
  savage dwelt near enough to Nature and Truth to borrow a trope from them. How can the
  scholar, who dwells away in the North West Territory or the Isle of Man, tell what is
  parliamentary in the kitchen?</p>

  <p>However, only one or two of my guests were ever bold enough to stay and eat a
  hasty-pudding with me; but when they saw that crisis approaching they beat a hasty
  retreat rather, as if it would shake the house to its foundations. Nevertheless, it
  stood through a great many hasty-puddings.</p>

  <p>I did not plaster till it was freezing weather. I brought over some whiter and
  cleaner sand for this purpose from the opposite shore of the pond in a boat, a sort of
  conveyance which would have tempted me to go much farther if necessary. My house had in
  the meanwhile been shingled down to the ground on every side. In lathing I was pleased
  to be able to send home each nail with a single blow of the hammer, and it was my
  ambition to transfer the plaster from the board to the wall neatly and rapidly. I
  remembered the story of a conceited fellow, who, in fine clothes, was wont to lounge
  about the village once, giving advice to workmen. Venturing one day to substitute deeds
  for words, he turned up his cuffs, seized a plasterer's board, and having loaded his
  trowel without mishap, with a complacent look toward the lathing overhead, made a bold
  gesture thitherward; and straightway, to his complete discomfiture, received the whole
  contents in his ruffled bosom. I admired anew the economy and convenience of
  plastering, which so effectually shuts out the cold and takes a handsome finish, and I
  learned the various casualties to which the plasterer is liable. I was surprised to see
  how thirsty the bricks were which drank up all the moisture in my plaster before I had
  smoothed it, and how many pailfuls of water it takes to christen a new hearth. I had
  the previous winter made a small quantity of lime by burning the shells of the <i>Unio
  fluviatilis</i>, which our river affords, for the sake of the experiment; so that I
  knew where my materials came from. I might have got good limestone within a mile or two
  and burned it myself, if I had cared to do so.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>The pond had in the meanwhile skimmed over in the shadiest and shallowest coves,
  some days or even weeks before the general freezing. The first ice is especially
  interesting and perfect, being hard, dark, and transparent, and affords the best
  opportunity that ever offers for examining the bottom where it is shallow; for you can
  lie at your length on ice only an inch thick, like a skater insect on the surface of
  the water, and study the bottom at your leisure, only two or three inches distant, like
  a picture behind a glass, and the water is necessarily always smooth then. There are
  many furrows in the sand where some creature has travelled about and doubled on its
  tracks; and, for wrecks, it is strewn with the cases of caddis-worms made of minute
  grains of white quartz. Perhaps these have creased it, for you find some of their cases
  in the furrows, though they are deep and broad for them to make. But the ice itself is
  the object of most interest, though you must improve the earliest opportunity to study
  it. If you examine it closely the morning after it freezes, you find that the greater
  part of the bubbles, which at first appeared to be within it, are against its under
  surface, and that more are continually rising from the bottom; while the ice is as yet
  comparatively solid and dark, that is, you see the water through it. These bubbles are
  from an eightieth to an eighth of an inch in diameter, very clear and beautiful, and
  you see your face reflected in them through the ice. There may be thirty or forty of
  them to a square inch. There are also already within the ice narrow oblong
  perpendicular bubbles about half an inch long, sharp cones with the apex upward; or
  oftener, if the ice is quite fresh, minute spherical bubbles one directly above
  another, like a string of beads. But these within the ice are not so numerous nor
  obvious as those beneath. I sometimes used to cast on stones to try the strength of the
  ice, and those which broke through carried in air with them, which formed very large
  and conspicuous white bubbles beneath. One day when I came to the same place
  forty-eight hours afterward, I found that those large bubbles were still perfect,
  though an inch more of ice had formed, as I could see distinctly by the seam in the
  edge of a cake. But as the last two days had been very warm, like an Indian summer, the
  ice was not now transparent, showing the dark green color of the water, and the bottom,
  but opaque and whitish or gray, and though twice as thick was hardly stronger than
  before, for the air bubbles had greatly expanded under this heat and run together, and
  lost their regularity; they were no longer one directly over another, but often like
  silvery coins poured from a bag, one overlapping another, or in thin flakes, as if
  occupying slight cleavages. The beauty of the ice was gone, and it was too late to
  study the bottom. Being curious to know what position my great bubbles occupied with
  regard to the new ice, I broke out a cake containing a middling sized one, and turned
  it bottom upward. The new ice had formed around and under the bubble, so that it was
  included between the two ices. It was wholly in the lower ice, but close against the
  upper, and was flattish, or perhaps slightly lenticular, with a rounded edge, a quarter
  of an inch deep by four inches in diameter; and I was surprised to find that directly
  under the bubble the ice was melted with great regularity in the form of a saucer
  reversed, to the height of five eighths of an inch in the middle, leaving a thin
  partition there between the water and the bubble, hardly an eighth of an inch thick;
  and in many places the small bubbles in this partition had burst out downward, and
  probably there was no ice at all under the largest bubbles, which were a foot in
  diameter. I inferred that the infinite number of minute bubbles which I had first seen
  against the under surface of the ice were now frozen in likewise, and that each, in its
  degree, had operated like a burning-glass on the ice beneath to melt and rot it. These
  are the little air-guns which contribute to make the ice crack and whoop.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>At length the winter set in good earnest, just as I had finished plastering, and the
  wind began to howl around the house as if it had not had permission to do so till then.
  Night after night the geese came lumbering in the dark with a clangor and a whistling
  of wings, even after the ground was covered with snow, some to alight in Walden, and
  some flying low over the woods toward Fair Haven, bound for Mexico. Several times, when
  returning from the village at ten or eleven o'clock at night, I heard the tread of a
  flock of geese, or else ducks, on the dry leaves in the woods by a pond-hole behind my
  dwelling, where they had come up to feed, and the faint honk or quack of their leader
  as they hurried off. In 1845 Walden froze entirely over for the first time on the night
  of the 22d of December, Flint's and other shallower ponds and the river having been
  frozen ten days or more; in '46, the 16th; in '49, about the 31st; and in '50, about
  the 27th of December; in '52, the 5th of January; in '53, the 31st of December. The
  snow had already covered the ground since the 25th of November, and surrounded me
  suddenly with the scenery of winter. I withdrew yet farther into my shell, and
  endeavored to keep a bright fire both within my house and within my breast. My
  employment out of doors now was to collect the dead wood in the forest, bringing it in
  my hands or on my shoulders, or sometimes trailing a dead pine tree under each arm to
  my shed. An old forest fence which had seen its best days was a great haul for me. I
  sacrificed it to Vulcan, for it was past serving the god Terminus. How much more
  interesting an event is that man's supper who has just been forth in the snow to hunt,
  nay, you might say, steal, the fuel to cook it with! His bread and meat are sweet.
  There are enough fagots and waste wood of all kinds in the forests of most of our towns
  to support many fires, but which at present warm none, and, some think, hinder the
  growth of the young wood. There was also the driftwood of the pond. In the course of
  the summer I had discovered a raft of pitch pine logs with the bark on, pinned together
  by the Irish when the railroad was built. This I hauled up partly on the shore. After
  soaking two years and then lying high six months it was perfectly sound, though
  waterlogged past drying. I amused myself one winter day with sliding this piecemeal
  across the pond, nearly half a mile, skating behind with one end of a log fifteen feet
  long on my shoulder, and the other on the ice; or I tied several logs together with a
  birch withe, and then, with a longer birch or alder which had a hook at the end,
  dragged them across. Though completely waterlogged and almost as heavy as lead, they
  not only burned long, but made a very hot fire; nay, I thought that they burned better
  for the soaking, as if the pitch, being confined by the water, burned longer, as in a
  lamp.</p>

  <p>Gilpin, in his account of the forest borderers of England, says that "the
  encroachments of trespassers, and the houses and fences thus raised on the borders of
  the forest," were "considered as great nuisances by the old forest law, and were
  severely punished under the name of <i>purprestures</i>, as tending <i>ad terrorem
  ferarum&#8212;ad nocumentum forestae</i>, etc.," to the frightening of the game and the
  detriment of the forest. But I was interested in the preservation of the venison and
  the vert more than the hunters or woodchoppers, and as much as though I had been the
  Lord Warden himself; and if any part was burned, though I burned it myself by accident,
  I grieved with a grief that lasted longer and was more inconsolable than that of the
  proprietors; nay, I grieved when it was cut down by the proprietors themselves. I would
  that our farmers when they cut down a forest felt some of that awe which the old Romans
  did when they came to thin, or let in the light to, a consecrated grove (<i>lucum
  conlucare</i>), that is, would believe that it is sacred to some god. The Roman made an
  expiatory offering, and prayed, Whatever god or goddess thou art to whom this grove is
  sacred, be propitious to me, my family, and children, etc.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable what a value is still put upon wood even in this age and in this
  new country, a value more permanent and universal than that of gold. After all our
  discoveries and inventions no man will go by a pile of wood. It is as precious to us as
  it was to our Saxon and Norman ancestors. If they made their bows of it, we make our
  gun-stocks of it. Michaux, more than thirty years ago, says that the price of wood for
  fuel in New York and Philadelphia "nearly equals, and sometimes exceeds, that of the
  best wood in Paris, though this immense capital annually requires more than three
  hundred thousand cords, and is surrounded to the distance of three hundred miles by
  cultivated plains." In this town the price of wood rises almost steadily, and the only
  question is, how much higher it is to be this year than it was the last. Mechanics and
  tradesmen who come in person to the forest on no other errand, are sure to attend the
  wood auction, and even pay a high price for the privilege of gleaning after the
  woodchopper. It is now many years that men have resorted to the forest for fuel and the
  materials of the arts: the New Englander and the New Hollander, the Parisian and the
  Celt, the farmer and Robin Hood, Goody Blake and Harry Gill; in most parts of the world
  the prince and the peasant, the scholar and the savage, equally require still a few
  sticks from the forest to warm them and cook their food. Neither could I do without
  them.</p>

  <p>Every man looks at his wood-pile with a kind of affection. I love to have mine
  before my window, and the more chips the better to remind me of my pleasing work. I had
  an old axe which nobody claimed, with which by spells in winter days, on the sunny side
  of the house, I played about the stumps which I had got out of my bean-field. As my
  driver prophesied when I was plowing, they warmed me twice&#8212;once while I was
  splitting them, and again when they were on the fire, so that no fuel could give out
  more heat. As for the axe, I was advised to get the village blacksmith to "jump" it;
  but I jumped him, and, putting a hickory helve from the woods into it, made it do. If
  it was dull, it was at least hung true.</p>

  <p>A few pieces of fat pine were a great treasure. It is interesting to remember how
  much of this food for fire is still concealed in the bowels of the earth. In previous
  years I had often gone prospecting over some bare hillside, where a pitch pine wood had
  formerly stood, and got out the fat pine roots. They are almost indestructible. Stumps
  thirty or forty years old, at least, will still be sound at the core, though the
  sapwood has all become vegetable mould, as appears by the scales of the thick bark
  forming a ring level with the earth four or five inches distant from the heart. With
  axe and shovel you explore this mine, and follow the marrowy store, yellow as beef
  tallow, or as if you had struck on a vein of gold, deep into the earth. But commonly I
  kindled my fire with the dry leaves of the forest, which I had stored up in my shed
  before the snow came. Green hickory finely split makes the woodchopper's kindlings,
  when he has a camp in the woods. Once in a while I got a little of this. When the
  villagers were lighting their fires beyond the horizon, I too gave notice to the
  various wild inhabitants of Walden vale, by a smoky streamer from my chimney, that I

           Melting thy pinions in thy upward flight,
           Lark without song, and messenger of dawn,
           Circling above the hamlets as thy nest;
           Or else, departing dream, and shadowy form
           Of midnight vision, gathering up thy skirts;
           By night star-veiling, and by day
           Darkening the light and blotting out the sun;
           Go thou my incense upward from this hearth,
           And ask the gods to pardon this clear flame.

  <p>Hard green wood just cut, though I used but little of that, answered my purpose
  better than any other. I sometimes left a good fire when I went to take a walk in a
  winter afternoon; and when I returned, three or four hours afterward, it would be still
  alive and glowing. My house was not empty though I was gone. It was as if I had left a
  cheerful housekeeper behind. It was I and Fire that lived there; and commonly my
  housekeeper proved trustworthy. One day, however, as I was splitting wood, I thought
  that I would just look in at the window and see if the house was not on fire; it was
  the only time I remember to have been particularly anxious on this score; so I looked
  and saw that a spark had caught my bed, and I went in and extinguished it when it had
  burned a place as big as my hand. But my house occupied so sunny and sheltered a
  position, and its roof was so low, that I could afford to let the fire go out in the
  middle of almost any winter day.</p>

  <p>The moles nested in my cellar, nibbling every third potato, and making a snug bed
  even there of some hair left after plastering and of brown paper; for even the wildest
  animals love comfort and warmth as well as man, and they survive the winter only
  because they are so careful to secure them. Some of my friends spoke as if I was coming
  to the woods on purpose to freeze myself. The animal merely makes a bed, which he warms
  with his body, in a sheltered place; but man, having discovered fire, boxes up some air
  in a spacious apartment, and warms that, instead of robbing himself, makes that his
  bed, in which he can move about divested of more cumbrous clothing, maintain a kind of
  summer in the midst of winter, and by means of windows even admit the light, and with a
  lamp lengthen out the day. Thus he goes a step or two beyond instinct, and saves a
  little time for the fine arts. Though, when I had been exposed to the rudest blasts a
  long time, my whole body began to grow torpid, when I reached the genial atmosphere of
  my house I soon recovered my faculties and prolonged my life. But the most luxuriously
  housed has little to boast of in this respect, nor need we trouble ourselves to
  speculate how the human race may be at last destroyed. It would be easy to cut their
  threads any time with a little sharper blast from the north. We go on dating from Cold
  Fridays and Great Snows; but a little colder Friday, or greater snow would put a period
  to man's existence on the globe.</p>

  <p>The next winter I used a small cooking-stove for economy, since I did not own the
  forest; but it did not keep fire so well as the open fireplace. Cooking was then, for
  the most part, no longer a poetic, but merely a chemic process. It will soon be
  forgotten, in these days of stoves, that we used to roast potatoes in the ashes, after
  the Indian fashion. The stove not only took up room and scented the house, but it
  concealed the fire, and I felt as if I had lost a companion. You can always see a face
  in the fire. The laborer, looking into it at evening, purifies his thoughts of the
  dross and earthiness which they have accumulated during the day. But I could no longer
  sit and look into the fire, and the pertinent words of a poet recurred to me with new
  force.&#8212;</p>
  <pre>     "Never, bright flame, may be denied to me
      Thy dear, life imaging, close sympathy.
      What but my hopes shot upward e'er so bright?
      What but my fortunes sunk so low in night?
      Why art thou banished from our hearth and hall,
      Thou who art welcomed and beloved by all?
      Was thy existence then too fanciful
      For our life's common light, who are so dull?
      Did thy bright gleam mysterious converse hold
      With our congenial souls? secrets too bold?

      Well, we are safe and strong, for now we sit
      Beside a hearth where no dim shadows flit,
      Where nothing cheers nor saddens, but a fire
      Warms feet and hands&#8212;nor does to more aspire;
      By whose compact utilitarian heap
      The present may sit down and go to sleep,
      Nor fear the ghosts who from the dim past walked,
      And with us by the unequal light of the old wood fire talked."

  <h2>Former Inhabitants and Winter Visitors</h2>

  <p>I weathered some merry snow-storms, and spent some cheerful winter evenings by my
  fireside, while the snow whirled wildly without, and even the hooting of the owl was
  hushed. For many weeks I met no one in my walks but those who came occasionally to cut
  wood and sled it to the village. The elements, however, abetted me in making a path
  through the deepest snow in the woods, for when I had once gone through the wind blew
  the oak leaves into my tracks, where they lodged, and by absorbing the rays of the sun
  melted the snow, and so not only made a my bed for my feet, but in the night their dark
  line was my guide. For human society I was obliged to conjure up the former occupants
  of these woods. Within the memory of many of my townsmen the road near which my house
  stands resounded with the laugh and gossip of inhabitants, and the woods which border
  it were notched and dotted here and there with their little gardens and dwellings,
  though it was then much more shut in by the forest than now. In some places, within my
  own remembrance, the pines would scrape both sides of a chaise at once, and women and
  children who were compelled to go this way to Lincoln alone and on foot did it with
  fear, and often ran a good part of the distance. Though mainly but a humble route to
  neighboring villages, or for the woodman's team, it once amused the traveller more than
  now by its variety, and lingered longer in his memory. Where now firm open fields
  stretch from the village to the woods, it then ran through a maple swamp on a
  foundation of logs, the remnants of which, doubtless, still underlie the present dusty
  highway, from the Stratton, now the Alms-House Farm, to Brister's Hill.</p>

  <p>East of my bean-field, across the road, lived Cato Ingraham, slave of Duncan
  Ingraham, Esquire, gentleman, of Concord village, who built his slave a house, and gave
  him permission to live in Walden Woods;&#8212;Cato, not Uticensis, but Concordiensis.
  Some say that he was a Guinea Negro. There are a few who remember his little patch
  among the walnuts, which he let grow up till he should be old and need them; but a
  younger and whiter speculator got them at last. He too, however, occupies an equally
  narrow house at present. Cato's half-obliterated cellar-hole still remains, though
  known to few, being concealed from the traveller by a fringe of pines. It is now filled
  with the smooth sumach (<i>Rhus glabra</i>), and one of the earliest species of
  goldenrod (<i>Solidago stricta</i>) grows there luxuriantly.</p>

  <p>Here, by the very corner of my field, still nearer to town, Zilpha, a colored woman,
  had her little house, where she spun linen for the townsfolk, making the Walden Woods
  ring with her shrill singing, for she had a loud and notable voice. At length, in the
  war of 1812, her dwelling was set on fire by English soldiers, prisoners on parole,
  when she was away, and her cat and dog and hens were all burned up together. She led a
  hard life, and somewhat inhumane. One old frequenter of these woods remembers, that as
  he passed her house one noon he heard her muttering to herself over her gurgling
  pot&#8212;"Ye are all bones, bones!" I have seen bricks amid the oak copse there.</p>

  <p>Down the road, on the right hand, on Brister's Hill, lived Brister Freeman, "a handy
  Negro," slave of Squire Cummings once&#8212;there where grow still the apple trees
  which Brister planted and tended; large old trees now, but their fruit still wild and
  ciderish to my taste. Not long since I read his epitaph in the old Lincoln
  burying-ground, a little on one side, near the unmarked graves of some British
  grenadiers who fell in the retreat from Concord&#8212;where he is styled "Sippio
  Brister"&#8212;Scipio Africanus he had some title to be called&#8212;"a man of color,"
  as if he were discolored. It also told me, with staring emphasis, when he died; which
  was but an indirect way of informing me that he ever lived. With him dwelt Fenda, his
  hospitable wife, who told fortunes, yet pleasantly&#8212;large, round, and black,
  blacker than any of the children of night, such a dusky orb as never rose on Concord
  before or since.</p>

  <p>Farther down the hill, on the left, on the old road in the woods, are marks of some
  homestead of the Stratton family; whose orchard once covered all the slope of Brister's
  Hill, but was long since killed out by pitch pines, excepting a few stumps, whose old
  roots furnish still the wild stocks of many a thrifty village tree.</p>

  <p>Nearer yet to town, you come to Breed's location, on the other side of the way, just
  on the edge of the wood; ground famous for the pranks of a demon not distinctly named
  in old mythology, who has acted a prominent and astounding part in our New England
  life, and deserves, as much as any mythological character, to have his biography
  written one day; who first comes in the guise of a friend or hired man, and then robs
  and murders the whole family&#8212;New-England Rum. But history must not yet tell the
  tragedies enacted here; let time intervene in some measure to assuage and lend an azure
  tint to them. Here the most indistinct and dubious tradition says that once a tavern
  stood; the well the same, which tempered the traveller's beverage and refreshed his
  steed. Here then men saluted one another, and heard and told the news, and went their
  ways again.</p>

  <p>Breed's hut was standing only a dozen years ago, though it had long been unoccupied.
  It was about the size of mine. It was set on fire by mischievous boys, one Election
  night, if I do not mistake. I lived on the edge of the village then, and had just lost
  myself over Davenant's "Gondibert," that winter that I labored with a
  lethargy&#8212;which, by the way, I never knew whether to regard as a family complaint,
  having an uncle who goes to sleep shaving himself, and is obliged to sprout potatoes in
  a cellar Sundays, in order to keep awake and keep the Sabbath, or as the consequence of
  my attempt to read Chalmers' collection of English poetry without skipping. It fairly
  overcame my Nervii. I had just sunk my head on this when the bells rung fire, and in
  hot haste the engines rolled that way, led by a straggling troop of men and boys, and I
  among the foremost, for I had leaped the brook. We thought it was far south over the
  woods&#8212;we who had run to fires before&#8212;barn, shop, or dwelling-house, or all
  together. "It's Baker's barn," cried one. "It is the Codman place," affirmed another.
  And then fresh sparks went up above the wood, as if the roof fell in, and we all
  shouted "Concord to the rescue!" Wagons shot past with furious speed and crushing
  loads, bearing, perchance, among the rest, the agent of the Insurance Company, who was
  bound to go however far; and ever and anon the engine bell tinkled behind, more slow
  and sure; and rearmost of all, as it was afterward whispered, came they who set the
  fire and gave the alarm. Thus we kept on like true idealists, rejecting the evidence of
  our senses, until at a turn in the road we heard the crackling and actually felt the
  heat of the fire from over the wall, and realized, alas! that we were there. The very
  nearness of the fire but cooled our ardor. At first we thought to throw a frog-pond on
  to it; but concluded to let it burn, it was so far gone and so worthless. So we stood
  round our engine, jostled one another, expressed our sentiments through
  speaking-trumpets, or in lower tone referred to the great conflagrations which the
  world has witnessed, including Bascom's shop, and, between ourselves, we thought that,
  were we there in season with our "tub," and a full frog-pond by, we could turn that
  threatened last and universal one into another flood. We finally retreated without
  doing any mischief&#8212;returned to sleep and "Gondibert." But as for "Gondibert," I
  would except that passage in the preface about wit being the soul's powder&#8212;"but
  most of mankind are strangers to wit, as Indians are to powder."</p>

  <p>It chanced that I walked that way across the fields the following night, about the
  same hour, and hearing a low moaning at this spot, I drew near in the dark, and
  discovered the only survivor of the family that I know, the heir of both its virtues
  and its vices, who alone was interested in this burning, lying on his stomach and
  looking over the cellar wall at the still smouldering cinders beneath, muttering to
  himself, as is his wont. He had been working far off in the river meadows all day, and
  had improved the first moments that he could call his own to visit the home of his
  fathers and his youth. He gazed into the cellar from all sides and points of view by
  turns, always lying down to it, as if there was some treasure, which he remembered,
  concealed between the stones, where there was absolutely nothing but a heap of bricks
  and ashes. The house being gone, he looked at what there was left. He was soothed by
  the sympathy which my mere presence implied, and showed me, as well as the darkness
  permitted, where the well was covered up; which, thank Heaven, could never be burned;
  and he groped long about the wall to find the well-sweep which his father had cut and
  mounted, feeling for the iron hook or staple by which a burden had been fastened to the
  heavy end&#8212;all that he could now cling to&#8212;to convince me that it was no
  common "rider." I felt it, and still remark it almost daily in my walks, for by it
  hangs the history of a family.</p>

  <p>Once more, on the left, where are seen the well and lilac bushes by the wall, in the
  now open field, lived Nutting and Le Grosse. But to return toward Lincoln.</p>

  <p>Farther in the woods than any of these, where the road approaches nearest to the
  pond, Wyman the potter squatted, and furnished his townsmen with earthenware, and left
  descendants to succeed him. Neither were they rich in worldly goods, holding the land
  by sufferance while they lived; and there often the sheriff came in vain to collect the
  taxes, and "attached a chip," for form's sake, as I have read in his accounts, there
  being nothing else that he could lay his hands on. One day in midsummer, when I was
  hoeing, a man who was carrying a load of pottery to market stopped his horse against my
  field and inquired concerning Wyman the younger. He had long ago bought a potter's
  wheel of him, and wished to know what had become of him. I had read of the potter's
  clay and wheel in Scripture, but it had never occurred to me that the pots we use were
  not such as had come down unbroken from those days, or grown on trees like gourds
  somewhere, and I was pleased to hear that so fictile an art was ever practiced in my
  neighborhood.</p>

  <p>The last inhabitant of these woods before me was an Irishman, Hugh Quoil (if I have
  spelt his name with coil enough), who occupied Wyman's tenement&#8212;Col. Quoil, he
  was called. Rumor said that he had been a soldier at Waterloo. If he had lived I should
  have made him fight his battles over again. His trade here was that of a ditcher.
  Napoleon went to St. Helena; Quoil came to Walden Woods. All I know of him is tragic.
  He was a man of manners, like one who had seen the world, and was capable of more civil
  speech than you could well attend to. He wore a greatcoat in midsummer, being affected
  with the trembling delirium, and his face was the color of carmine. He died in the road
  at the foot of Brister's Hill shortly after I came to the woods, so that I have not
  remembered him as a neighbor. Before his house was pulled down, when his comrades
  avoided it as "an unlucky castle," I visited it. There lay his old clothes curled up by
  use, as if they were himself, upon his raised plank bed. His pipe lay broken on the
  hearth, instead of a bowl broken at the fountain. The last could never have been the
  symbol of his death, for he confessed to me that, though he had heard of Brister's
  Spring, he had never seen it; and soiled cards, kings of diamonds, spades, and hearts,
  were scattered over the floor. One black chicken which the administrator could not
  catch, black as night and as silent, not even croaking, awaiting Reynard, still went to
  roost in the next apartment. In the rear there was the dim outline of a garden, which
  had been planted but had never received its first hoeing, owing to those terrible
  shaking fits, though it was now harvest time. It was overrun with Roman wormwood and
  beggar-ticks, which last stuck to my clothes for all fruit. The skin of a woodchuck was
  freshly stretched upon the back of the house, a trophy of his last Waterloo; but no
  warm cap or mittens would he want more.</p>

  <p>Now only a dent in the earth marks the site of these dwellings, with buried cellar
  stones, and strawberries, raspberries, thimble-berries, hazel-bushes, and sumachs
  growing in the sunny sward there; some pitch pine or gnarled oak occupies what was the
  chimney nook, and a sweet-scented black birch, perhaps, waves where the door-stone was.
  Sometimes the well dent is visible, where once a spring oozed; now dry and tearless
  grass; or it was covered deep&#8212;not to be discovered till some late day&#8212;with
  a flat stone under the sod, when the last of the race departed. What a sorrowful act
  must that be&#8212;the covering up of wells! coincident with the opening of wells of
  tears. These cellar dents, like deserted fox burrows, old holes, are all that is left
  where once were the stir and bustle of human life, and "fate, free will, foreknowledge
  absolute," in some form and dialect or other were by turns discussed. But all I can
  learn of their conclusions amounts to just this, that "Cato and Brister pulled wool";
  which is about as edifying as the history of more famous schools of philosophy.</p>

  <p>Still grows the vivacious lilac a generation after the door and lintel and the sill
  are gone, unfolding its sweet-scented flowers each spring, to be plucked by the musing
  traveller; planted and tended once by children's hands, in front-yard plots&#8212;now
  standing by wallsides in retired pastures, and giving place to new-rising
  forests;&#8212;the last of that stirp, sole survivor of that family. Little did the
  dusky children think that the puny slip with its two eyes only, which they stuck in the
  ground in the shadow of the house and daily watered, would root itself so, and outlive
  them, and house itself in the rear that shaded it, and grown man's garden and orchard,
  and tell their story faintly to the lone wanderer a half-century after they had grown
  up and died&#8212;blossoming as fair, and smelling as sweet, as in that first spring. I
  mark its still tender, civil, cheerful lilac colors.</p>

  <p>But this small village, germ of something more, why did it fail while Concord keeps
  its ground? Were there no natural advantages&#8212;no water privileges, forsooth? Ay,
  the deep Walden Pond and cool Brister's Spring&#8212;privilege to drink long and
  healthy draughts at these, all unimproved by these men but to dilute their glass. They
  were universally a thirsty race. Might not the basket, stable-broom, mat-making,
  corn-parching, linen-spinning, and pottery business have thrived here, making the
  wilderness to blossom like the rose, and a numerous posterity have inherited the land
  of their fathers? The sterile soil would at least have been proof against a low-land
  degeneracy. Alas! how little does the memory of these human inhabitants enhance the
  beauty of the landscape! Again, perhaps, Nature will try, with me for a first settler,
  and my house raised last spring to be the oldest in the hamlet.</p>

  <p>I am not aware that any man has ever built on the spot which I occupy. Deliver me
  from a city built on the site of a more ancient city, whose materials are ruins, whose
  gardens cemeteries. The soil is blanched and accursed there, and before that becomes
  necessary the earth itself will be destroyed. With such reminiscences I repeopled the
  woods and lulled myself asleep.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>At this season I seldom had a visitor. When the snow lay deepest no wanderer
  ventured near my house for a week or fortnight at a time, but there I lived as snug as
  a meadow mouse, or as cattle and poultry which are said to have survived for a long
  time buried in drifts, even without food; or like that early settler's family in the
  town of Sutton, in this State, whose cottage was completely covered by the great snow
  of 1717 when he was absent, and an Indian found it only by the hole which the chimney's
  breath made in the drift, and so relieved the family. But no friendly Indian concerned
  himself about me; nor needed he, for the master of the house was at home. The Great
  Snow! How cheerful it is to hear of! When the farmers could not get to the woods and
  swamps with their teams, and were obliged to cut down the shade trees before their
  houses, and, when the crust was harder, cut off the trees in the swamps, ten feet from
  the ground, as it appeared the next spring.</p>

  <p>In the deepest snows, the path which I used from the highway to my house, about half
  a mile long, might have been represented by a meandering dotted line, with wide
  intervals between the dots. For a week of even weather I took exactly the same number
  of steps, and of the same length, coming and going, stepping deliberately and with the
  precision of a pair of dividers in my own deep tracks&#8212;to such routine the winter
  reduces us&#8212;yet often they were filled with heaven's own blue. But no weather
  interfered fatally with my walks, or rather my going abroad, for I frequently tramped
  eight or ten miles through the deepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech tree,
  or a yellow birch, or an old acquaintance among the pines; when the ice and snow
  causing their limbs to droop, and so sharpening their tops, had changed the pines into
  fir trees; wading to the tops of the highest hills when the show was nearly two feet
  deep on a level, and shaking down another snow-storm on my head at every step; or
  sometimes creeping and floundering thither on my hands and knees, when the hunters had
  gone into winter quarters. One afternoon I amused myself by watching a barred owl
  (<i>Strix nebulosa</i>) sitting on one of the lower dead limbs of a white pine, close
  to the trunk, in broad daylight, I standing within a rod of him. He could hear me when
  I moved and cronched the snow with my feet, but could not plainly see me. When I made
  most noise he would stretch out his neck, and erect his neck feathers, and open his
  eyes wide; but their lids soon fell again, and he began to nod. I too felt a slumberous
  influence after watching him half an hour, as he sat thus with his eyes half open, like
  a cat, winged brother of the cat. There was only a narrow slit left between their lids,
  by which he preserved a peninsular relation to me; thus, with half-shut eyes, looking
  out from the land of dreams, and endeavoring to realize me, vague object or mote that
  interrupted his visions. At length, on some louder noise or my nearer approach, he
  would grow uneasy and sluggishly turn about on his perch, as if impatient at having his
  dreams disturbed; and when he launched himself off and flapped through the pines,
  spreading his wings to unexpected breadth, I could not hear the slightest sound from
  them. Thus, guided amid the pine boughs rather by a delicate sense of their
  neighborhood than by sight, feeling his twilight way, as it were, with his sensitive
  pinions, he found a new perch, where he might in peace await the dawning of his
  day.</p>

  <p>As I walked over the long causeway made for the railroad through the meadows, I
  encountered many a blustering and nipping wind, for nowhere has it freer play; and when
  the frost had smitten me on one cheek, heathen as I was, I turned to it the other also.
  Nor was it much better by the carriage road from Brister's Hill. For I came to town
  still, like a friendly Indian, when the contents of the broad open fields were all
  piled up between the walls of the Walden road, and half an hour sufficed to obliterate
  the tracks of the last traveller. And when I returned new drifts would have formed,
  through which I floundered, where the busy northwest wind had been depositing the
  powdery snow round a sharp angle in the road, and not a rabbit's track, nor even the
  fine print, the small type, of a meadow mouse was to be seen. Yet I rarely failed to
  find, even in midwinter, some warm and springly swamp where the grass and the
  skunk-cabbage still put forth with perennial verdure, and some hardier bird
  occasionally awaited the return of spring.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, notwithstanding the snow, when I returned from my walk at evening I
  crossed the deep tracks of a woodchopper leading from my door, and found his pile of
  whittlings on the hearth, and my house filled with the odor of his pipe. Or on a Sunday
  afternoon, if I chanced to be at home, I heard the cronching of the snow made by the
  step of a long-headed farmer, who from far through the woods sought my house, to have a
  social "crack"; one of the few of his vocation who are "men on their farms"; who donned
  a frock instead of a professor's gown, and is as ready to extract the moral out of
  church or state as to haul a load of manure from his barn-yard. We talked of rude and
  simple times, when men sat about large fires in cold, bracing weather, with clear
  heads; and when other dessert failed, we tried our teeth on many a nut which wise
  squirrels have long since abandoned, for those which have the thickest shells are
  commonly empty.</p>

  <p>The one who came from farthest to my lodge, through deepest snows and most dismal
  tempests, was a poet. A farmer, a hunter, a soldier, a reporter, even a philosopher,
  may be daunted; but nothing can deter a poet, for he is actuated by pure love. Who can
  predict his comings and goings? His business calls him out at all hours, even when
  doctors sleep. We made that small house ring with boisterous mirth and resound with the
  murmur of much sober talk, making amends then to Walden vale for the long silences.
  Broadway was still and deserted in comparison. At suitable intervals there were regular
  salutes of laughter, which might have been referred indifferently to the last-uttered
  or the forth-coming jest. We made many a "bran new" theory of life over a thin dish of
  gruel, which combined the advantages of conviviality with the clear-headedness which
  philosophy requires.</p>

  <p>I should not forget that during my last winter at the pond there was another welcome
  visitor, who at one time came through the village, through snow and rain and darkness,
  till he saw my lamp through the trees, and shared with me some long winter evenings.
  One of the last of the philosophers&#8212;Connecticut gave him to the world&#8212;he
  peddled first her wares, afterwards, as he declares, his brains. These he peddles
  still, prompting God and disgracing man, bearing for fruit his brain only, like the nut
  its kernel. I think that he must be the man of the most faith of any alive. His words
  and attitude always suppose a better state of things than other men are acquainted
  with, and he will be the last man to be disappointed as the ages revolve. He has no
  venture in the present. But though comparatively disregarded now, when his day comes,
  laws unsuspected by most will take effect, and masters of families and rulers will come
  to him for advice.</p>
  <pre>               "How blind that cannot see serenity!"
</pre>

  <p class="nind">A true friend of man; almost the only friend of human progress. An Old
  Mortality, say rather an Immortality, with unwearied patience and faith making plain
  the image engraven in men's bodies, the God of whom they are but defaced and leaning
  monuments. With his hospitable intellect he embraces children, beggars, insane, and
  scholars, and entertains the thought of all, adding to it commonly some breadth and
  elegance. I think that he should keep a caravansary on the world's highway, where
  philosophers of all nations might put up, and on his sign should be printed,
  "Entertainment for man, but not for his beast. Enter ye that have leisure and a quiet
  mind, who earnestly seek the right road." He is perhaps the sanest man and has the
  fewest crotchets of any I chance to know; the same yesterday and tomorrow. Of yore we
  had sauntered and talked, and effectually put the world behind us; for he was pledged
  to no institution in it, freeborn, <i>ingenuus</i>. Whichever way we turned, it seemed
  that the heavens and the earth had met together, since he enhanced the beauty of the
  landscape. A blue-robed man, whose fittest roof is the overarching sky which reflects
  his serenity. I do not see how he can ever die; Nature cannot spare him.</p>

  <p>Having each some shingles of thought well dried, we sat and whittled them, trying
  our knives, and admiring the clear yellowish grain of the pumpkin pine. We waded so
  gently and reverently, or we pulled together so smoothly, that the fishes of thought
  were not scared from the stream, nor feared any angler on the bank, but came and went
  grandly, like the clouds which float through the western sky, and the mother-o'-pearl
  flocks which sometimes form and dissolve there. There we worked, revising mythology,
  rounding a fable here and there, and building castles in the air for which earth
  offered no worthy foundation. Great Looker! Great Expecter! to converse with whom was a
  New England Night's Entertainment. Ah! such discourse we had, hermit and philosopher,
  and the old settler I have spoken of&#8212;we three&#8212;it expanded and racked my
  little house; I should not dare to say how many pounds' weight there was above the
  atmospheric pressure on every circular inch; it opened its seams so that they had to be
  calked with much dulness thereafter to stop the consequent leak;&#8212;but I had enough
  of that kind of oakum already picked.</p>

  <p>There was one other with whom I had "solid seasons," long to be remembered, at his
  house in the village, and who looked in upon me from time to time; but I had no more
  for society there.</p>

  <p>There too, as everywhere, I sometimes expected the Visitor who never comes. The
  Vishnu Purana says, "The house-holder is to remain at eventide in his courtyard as long
  as it takes to milk a cow, or longer if he pleases, to await the arrival of a guest." I
  often performed this duty of hospitality, waited long enough to milk a whole herd of
  cows, but did not see the man approaching from the town.</p>

  <h2>Winter Animals</h2>

  <p>When the ponds were firmly frozen, they afforded not only new and shorter routes to
  many points, but new views from their surfaces of the familiar landscape around them.
  When I crossed Flint's Pond, after it was covered with snow, though I had often paddled
  about and skated over it, it was so unexpectedly wide and so strange that I could think
  of nothing but Baffin's Bay. The Lincoln hills rose up around me at the extremity of a
  snowy plain, in which I did not remember to have stood before; and the fishermen, at an
  indeterminable distance over the ice, moving slowly about with their wolfish dogs,
  passed for sealers, or Esquimaux, or in misty weather loomed like fabulous creatures,
  and I did not know whether they were giants or pygmies. I took this course when I went
  to lecture in Lincoln in the evening, travelling in no road and passing no house
  between my own hut and the lecture room. In Goose Pond, which lay in my way, a colony
  of muskrats dwelt, and raised their cabins high above the ice, though none could be
  seen abroad when I crossed it. Walden, being like the rest usually bare of snow, or
  with only shallow and interrupted drifts on it, was my yard where I could walk freely
  when the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level elsewhere and the villagers were
  confined to their streets. There, far from the village street, and except at very long
  intervals, from the jingle of sleigh-bells, I slid and skated, as in a vast moose-yard
  well trodden, overhung by oak woods and solemn pines bent down with snow or bristling
  with icicles.</p>

  <p>For sounds in winter nights, and often in winter days, I heard the forlorn but
  melodious note of a hooting owl indefinitely far; such a sound as the frozen earth
  would yield if struck with a suitable plectrum, the very <i>lingua vernacula</i> of
  Walden Wood, and quite familiar to me at last, though I never saw the bird while it was
  making it. I seldom opened my door in a winter evening without hearing it; <i>Hoo hoo
  hoo, hoorer, hoo,</i> sounded sonorously, and the first three syllables accented
  somewhat like <i>how der do</i>; or sometimes <i>hoo, hoo</i> only. One night in the
  beginning of winter, before the pond froze over, about nine o'clock, I was startled by
  the loud honking of a goose, and, stepping to the door, heard the sound of their wings
  like a tempest in the woods as they flew low over my house. They passed over the pond
  toward Fair Haven, seemingly deterred from settling by my light, their commodore
  honking all the while with a regular beat. Suddenly an unmistakable cat-owl from very
  near me, with the most harsh and tremendous voice I ever heard from any inhabitant of
  the woods, responded at regular intervals to the goose, as if determined to expose and
  disgrace this intruder from Hudson's Bay by exhibiting a greater compass and volume of
  voice in a native, and <i>boo-hoo</i> him out of Concord horizon. What do you mean by
  alarming the citadel at this time of night consecrated to me? Do you think I am ever
  caught napping at such an hour, and that I have not got lungs and a larynx as well as
  yourself? <i>Boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo!</i> It was one of the most thrilling discords I
  ever heard. And yet, if you had a discriminating ear, there were in it the elements of
  a concord such as these plains never saw nor heard.</p>

  <p>I also heard the whooping of the ice in the pond, my great bed-fellow in that part
  of Concord, as if it were restless in its bed and would fain turn over, were troubled
  with flatulency and had dreams; or I was waked by the cracking of the ground by the
  frost, as if some one had driven a team against my door, and in the morning would find
  a crack in the earth a quarter of a mile long and a third of an inch wide.</p>

  <p>Sometimes I heard the foxes as they ranged over the snow-crust, in moonlight nights,
  in search of a partridge or other game, barking raggedly and demoniacally like forest
  dogs, as if laboring with some anxiety, or seeking expression, struggling for light and
  to be dogs outright and run freely in the streets; for if we take the ages into our
  account, may there not be a civilization going on among brutes as well as men? They
  seemed to me to be rudimental, burrowing men, still standing on their defence, awaiting
  their transformation. Sometimes one came near to my window, attracted by my light,
  barked a vulpine curse at me, and then retreated.</p>

  <p>Usually the red squirrel (<i>Sciurus Hudsonius</i>) waked me in the dawn, coursing
  over the roof and up and down the sides of the house, as if sent out of the woods for
  this purpose. In the course of the winter I threw out half a bushel of ears of sweet
  corn, which had not got ripe, on to the snow-crust by my door, and was amused by
  watching the motions of the various animals which were baited by it. In the twilight
  and the night the rabbits came regularly and made a hearty meal. All day long the red
  squirrels came and went, and afforded me much entertainment by their manoeuvres. One
  would approach at first warily through the shrub oaks, running over the snow-crust by
  fits and starts like a leaf blown by the wind, now a few paces this way, with wonderful
  speed and waste of energy, making inconceivable haste with his "trotters," as if it
  were for a wager, and now as many paces that way, but never getting on more than half a
  rod at a time; and then suddenly pausing with a ludicrous expression and a gratuitous
  somerset, as if all the eyes in the universe were eyed on him&#8212;for all the motions
  of a squirrel, even in the most solitary recesses of the forest, imply spectators as
  much as those of a dancing girl&#8212;wasting more time in delay and circumspection
  than would have sufficed to walk the whole distance&#8212;I never saw one
  walk&#8212;and then suddenly, before you could say Jack Robinson, he would be in the
  top of a young pitch pine, winding up his clock and chiding all imaginary spectators,
  soliloquizing and talking to all the universe at the same time&#8212;for no reason that
  I could ever detect, or he himself was aware of, I suspect. At length he would reach
  the corn, and selecting a suitable ear, frisk about in the same uncertain
  trigonometrical way to the topmost stick of my wood-pile, before my window, where he
  looked me in the face, and there sit for hours, supplying himself with a new ear from
  time to time, nibbling at first voraciously and throwing the half-naked cobs about;
  till at length he grew more dainty still and played with his food, tasting only the
  inside of the kernel, and the ear, which was held balanced over the stick by one paw,
  slipped from his careless grasp and fell to the ground, when he would look over at it
  with a ludicrous expression of uncertainty, as if suspecting that it had life, with a
  mind not made up whether to get it again, or a new one, or be off; now thinking of
  corn, then listening to hear what was in the wind. So the little impudent fellow would
  waste many an ear in a forenoon; till at last, seizing some longer and plumper one,
  considerably bigger than himself, and skilfully balancing it, he would set out with it
  to the woods, like a tiger with a buffalo, by the same zig-zag course and frequent
  pauses, scratching along with it as if it were too heavy for him and falling all the
  while, making its fall a diagonal between a perpendicular and horizontal, being
  determined to put it through at any rate;&#8212;a singularly frivolous and whimsical
  fellow;&#8212;and so he would get off with it to where he lived, perhaps carry it to
  the top of a pine tree forty or fifty rods distant, and I would afterwards find the
  cobs strewn about the woods in various directions.</p>

  <p>At length the jays arrive, whose discordant screams were heard long before, as they
  were warily making their approach an eighth of a mile off, and in a stealthy and
  sneaking manner they flit from tree to tree, nearer and nearer, and pick up the kernels
  which the squirrels have dropped. Then, sitting on a pitch pine bough, they attempt to
  swallow in their haste a kernel which is too big for their throats and chokes them; and
  after great labor they disgorge it, and spend an hour in the endeavor to crack it by
  repeated blows with their bills. They were manifestly thieves, and I had not much
  respect for them; but the squirrels, though at first shy, went to work as if they were
  taking what was their own.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile also came the chickadees in flocks, which, picking up the crumbs the
  squirrels had dropped, flew to the nearest twig and, placing them under their claws,
  hammered away at them with their little bills, as if it were an insect in the bark,
  till they were sufficiently reduced for their slender throats. A little flock of these
  titmice came daily to pick a dinner out of my woodpile, or the crumbs at my door, with
  faint flitting lisping notes, like the tinkling of icicles in the grass, or else with
  sprightly <i>day day day</i>, or more rarely, in spring-like days, a wiry summery
  <i>phe-be</i> from the woodside. They were so familiar that at length one alighted on
  an armful of wood which I was carrying in, and pecked at the sticks without fear. I
  once had a sparrow alight upon my shoulder for a moment while I was hoeing in a village
  garden, and I felt that I was more distinguished by that circumstance than I should
  have been by any epaulet I could have worn. The squirrels also grew at last to be quite
  familiar, and occasionally stepped upon my shoe, when that was the nearest way.</p>

  <p>When the ground was not yet quite covered, and again near the end of winter, when
  the snow was melted on my south hillside and about my wood-pile, the partridges came
  out of the woods morning and evening to feed there. Whichever side you walk in the
  woods the partridge bursts away on whirring wings, jarring the snow from the dry leaves
  and twigs on high, which comes sifting down in the sunbeams like golden dust, for this
  brave bird is not to be scared by winter. It is frequently covered up by drifts, and,
  it is said, "sometimes plunges from on wing into the soft snow, where it remains
  concealed for a day or two." I used to start them in the open land also, where they had
  come out of the woods at sunset to "bud" the wild apple trees. They will come regularly
  every evening to particular trees, where the cunning sportsman lies in wait for them,
  and the distant orchards next the woods suffer thus not a little. I am glad that the
  partridge gets fed, at any rate. It is Nature's own bird which lives on buds and diet
  drink.</p>

  <p>In dark winter mornings, or in short winter afternoons, I sometimes heard a pack of
  hounds threading all the woods with hounding cry and yelp, unable to resist the
  instinct of the chase, and the note of the hunting-horn at intervals, proving that man
  was in the rear. The woods ring again, and yet no fox bursts forth on to the open level
  of the pond, nor following pack pursuing their Act&#230;on. And perhaps at evening I
  see the hunters returning with a single brush trailing from their sleigh for a trophy,
  seeking their inn. They tell me that if the fox would remain in the bosom of the frozen
  earth he would be safe, or if he would run in a straight line away no foxhound could
  overtake him; but, having left his pursuers far behind, he stops to rest and listen
  till they come up, and when he runs he circles round to his old haunts, where the
  hunters await him. Sometimes, however, he will run upon a wall many rods, and then leap
  off far to one side, and he appears to know that water will not retain his scent. A
  hunter told me that he once saw a fox pursued by hounds burst out on to Walden when the
  ice was covered with shallow puddles, run part way across, and then return to the same
  shore. Ere long the hounds arrived, but here they lost the scent. Sometimes a pack
  hunting by themselves would pass my door, and circle round my house, and yelp and hound
  without regarding me, as if afflicted by a species of madness, so that nothing could
  divert them from the pursuit. Thus they circle until they fall upon the recent trail of
  a fox, for a wise hound will forsake everything else for this. One day a man came to my
  hut from Lexington to inquire after his hound that made a large track, and had been
  hunting for a week by himself. But I fear that he was not the wiser for all I told him,
  for every time I attempted to answer his questions he interrupted me by asking, "What
  do you do here?" He had lost a dog, but found a man.</p>

  <p>One old hunter who has a dry tongue, who used to come to bathe in Walden once every
  year when the water was warmest, and at such times looked in upon me, told me that many
  years ago he took his gun one afternoon and went out for a cruise in Walden Wood; and
  as he walked the Wayland road he heard the cry of hounds approaching, and ere long a
  fox leaped the wall into the road, and as quick as thought leaped the other wall out of
  the road, and his swift bullet had not touched him. Some way behind came an old hound
  and her three pups in full pursuit, hunting on their own account, and disappeared again
  in the woods. Late in the afternoon, as he was resting in the thick woods south of
  Walden, he heard the voice of the hounds far over toward Fair Haven still pursuing the
  fox; and on they came, their hounding cry which made all the woods ring sounding nearer
  and nearer, now from Well Meadow, now from the Baker Farm. For a long time he stood
  still and listened to their music, so sweet to a hunter's ear, when suddenly the fox
  appeared, threading the solemn aisles with an easy coursing pace, whose sound was
  concealed by a sympathetic rustle of the leaves, swift and still, keeping the round,
  leaving his pursuers far behind; and, leaping upon a rock amid the woods, he sat erect
  and listening, with his back to the hunter. For a moment compassion restrained the
  latter's arm; but that was a short-lived mood, and as quick as thought can follow
  thought his piece was levelled, and <i>whang!</i>&#8212;the fox, rolling over the rock,
  lay dead on the ground. The hunter still kept his place and listened to the hounds.
  Still on they came, and now the near woods resounded through all their aisles with
  their demoniac cry. At length the old hound burst into view with muzzle to the ground,
  and snapping the air as if possessed, and ran directly to the rock; but, spying the
  dead fox, she suddenly ceased her hounding as if struck dumb with amazement, and walked
  round and round him in silence; and one by one her pups arrived, and, like their
  mother, were sobered into silence by the mystery. Then the hunter came forward and
  stood in their midst, and the mystery was solved. They waited in silence while he
  skinned the fox, then followed the brush a while, and at length turned off into the
  woods again. That evening a Weston squire came to the Concord hunter's cottage to
  inquire for his hounds, and told how for a week they had been hunting on their own
  account from Weston woods. The Concord hunter told him what he knew and offered him the
  skin; but the other declined it and departed. He did not find his hounds that night,
  but the next day learned that they had crossed the river and put up at a farmhouse for
  the night, whence, having been well fed, they took their departure early in the
  morning.</p>

  <p>The hunter who told me this could remember one Sam Nutting, who used to hunt bears
  on Fair Haven Ledges, and exchange their skins for rum in Concord village; who told
  him, even, that he had seen a moose there. Nutting had a famous foxhound named
  Burgoyne&#8212;he pronounced it Bugine&#8212;which my informant used to borrow. In the
  "Wast Book" of an old trader of this town, who was also a captain, town-clerk, and
  representative, I find the following entry. Jan. 18th, 1742-3, "John Melven Cr. by 1
  Grey Fox 0&#8212;2&#8212;3"; they are not now found here; and in his ledger, Feb, 7th,
  1743, Hezekiah Stratton has credit "by 1/2 a Catt skin 0&#8212;1&#8212;4-1/2"; of
  course, a wild-cat, for Stratton was a sergeant in the old French war, and would not
  have got credit for hunting less noble game. Credit is given for deerskins also, and
  they were daily sold. One man still preserves the horns of the last deer that was
  killed in this vicinity, and another has told me the particulars of the hunt in which
  his uncle was engaged. The hunters were formerly a numerous and merry crew here. I
  remember well one gaunt Nimrod who would catch up a leaf by the roadside and play a
  strain on it wilder and more melodious, if my memory serves me, than any
  hunting-horn.</p>

  <p>At midnight, when there was a moon, I sometimes met with hounds in my path prowling
  about the woods, which would skulk out of my way, as if afraid, and stand silent amid
  the bushes till I had passed.</p>

  <p>Squirrels and wild mice disputed for my store of nuts. There were scores of pitch
  pines around my house, from one to four inches in diameter, which had been gnawed by
  mice the previous winter&#8212;a Norwegian winter for them, for the snow lay long and
  deep, and they were obliged to mix a large proportion of pine bark with their other
  diet. These trees were alive and apparently flourishing at midsummer, and many of them
  had grown a foot, though completely girdled; but after another winter such were without
  exception dead. It is remarkable that a single mouse should thus be allowed a whole
  pine tree for its dinner, gnawing round instead of up and down it; but perhaps it is
  necessary in order to thin these trees, which are wont to grow up densely.</p>

  <p>The hares (<i>Lepus Americanus</i>) were very familiar. One had her form under my
  house all winter, separated from me only by the flooring, and she startled me each
  morning by her hasty departure when I began to stir&#8212;thump, thump, thump, striking
  her head against the floor timbers in her hurry. They used to come round my door at
  dusk to nibble the potato parings which I had thrown out, and were so nearly the color
  of the ground that they could hardly be distinguished when still. Sometimes in the
  twilight I alternately lost and recovered sight of one sitting motionless under my
  window. When I opened my door in the evening, off they would go with a squeak and a
  bounce. Near at hand they only excited my pity. One evening one sat by my door two
  paces from me, at first trembling with fear, yet unwilling to move; a poor wee thing,
  lean and bony, with ragged ears and sharp nose, scant tail and slender paws. It looked
  as if Nature no longer contained the breed of nobler bloods, but stood on her last
  toes. Its large eyes appeared young and unhealthy, almost dropsical. I took a step, and
  lo, away it scud with an elastic spring over the snow-crust, straightening its body and
  its limbs into graceful length, and soon put the forest between me and itself&#8212;the
  wild free venison, asserting its vigor and the dignity of Nature. Not without reason
  was its slenderness. Such then was its nature. (<i>Lepus</i>, <i>levipes</i>,
  light-foot, some think.)</p>

  <p>What is a country without rabbits and partridges? They are among the most simple and
  indigenous animal products; ancient and venerable families known to antiquity as to
  modern times; of the very hue and substance of Nature, nearest allied to leaves and to
  the ground&#8212;and to one another; it is either winged or it is legged. It is hardly
  as if you had seen a wild creature when a rabbit or a partridge bursts away, only a
  natural one, as much to be expected as rustling leaves. The partridge and the rabbit
  are still sure to thrive, like true natives of the soil, whatever revolutions occur. If
  the forest is cut off, the sprouts and bushes which spring up afford them concealment,
  and they become more numerous than ever. That must be a poor country indeed that does
  not support a hare. Our woods teem with them both, and around every swamp may be seen
  the partridge or rabbit walk, beset with twiggy fences and horse-hair snares, which
  some cow-boy tends.</p>

  <h2>The Pond in Winter</h2>

  <p>After a still winter night I awoke with the impression that some question had been
  put to me, which I had been endeavoring in vain to answer in my sleep, as
  what&#8212;how&#8212;when&#8212;where? But there was dawning Nature, in whom all
  creatures live, looking in at my broad windows with serene and satisfied face, and no
  question on <i>her</i> lips. I awoke to an answered question, to Nature and daylight.
  The snow lying deep on the earth dotted with young pines, and the very slope of the
  hill on which my house is placed, seemed to say, Forward! Nature puts no question and
  answers none which we mortals ask. She has long ago taken her resolution. "O Prince,
  our eyes contemplate with admiration and transmit to the soul the wonderful and varied
  spectacle of this universe. The night veils without doubt a part of this glorious
  creation; but day comes to reveal to us this great work, which extends from earth even
  into the plains of the ether."</p>

  <p>Then to my morning work. First I take an axe and pail and go in search of water, if
  that be not a dream. After a cold and snowy night it needed a divining-rod to find it.
  Every winter the liquid and trembling surface of the pond, which was so sensitive to
  every breath, and reflected every light and shadow, becomes solid to the depth of a
  foot or a foot and a half, so that it will support the heaviest teams, and perchance
  the snow covers it to an equal depth, and it is not to be distinguished from any level
  field. Like the marmots in the surrounding hills, it closes its eyelids and becomes
  dormant for three months or more. Standing on the snow-covered plain, as if in a
  pasture amid the hills, I cut my way first through a foot of snow, and then a foot of
  ice, and open a window under my feet, where, kneeling to drink, I look down into the
  quiet parlor of the fishes, pervaded by a softened light as through a window of ground
  glass, with its bright sanded floor the same as in summer; there a perennial waveless
  serenity reigns as in the amber twilight sky, corresponding to the cool and even
  temperament of the inhabitants. Heaven is under our feet is well as over our heads.</p>

  <p>Early in the morning, while all things are crisp with frost, men come with
  fishing-reels and slender lunch, and let down their fine lines through the snowy field
  to take pickerel and perch; wild men, who instinctively follow other fashions and trust
  other authorities than their townsmen, and by their goings and comings stitch towns
  together in parts where else they would be ripped. They sit and eat their luncheon in
  stout fear-naughts on the dry oak leaves on the shore, as wise in natural lore as the
  citizen is in artificial. They never consulted with books, and know and can tell much
  less than they have done. The things which they practice are said not yet to be known.
  Here is one fishing for pickerel with grown perch for bait. You look into his pail with
  wonder as into a summer pond, as if he kept summer locked up at home, or knew where she
  had retreated. How, pray, did he get these in midwinter? Oh, he got worms out of rotten
  logs since the ground froze, and so he caught them. His life itself passes deeper in
  nature than the studies of the naturalist penetrate; himself a subject for the
  naturalist. The latter raises the moss and bark gently with his knife in search of
  insects; the former lays open logs to their core with his axe, and moss and bark fly
  far and wide. He gets his living by barking trees. Such a man has some right to fish,
  and I love to see nature carried out in him. The perch swallows the grub-worm, the
  pickerel swallows the perch, and the fisher-man swallows the pickerel; and so all the
  chinks in the scale of being are filled.</p>

  <p>When I strolled around the pond in misty weather I was sometimes amused by the
  primitive mode which some ruder fisherman had adopted. He would perhaps have placed
  alder branches over the narrow holes in the ice, which were four or five rods apart and
  an equal distance from the shore, and having fastened the end of the line to a stick to
  prevent its being pulled through, have passed the slack line over a twig of the alder,
  a foot or more above the ice, and tied a dry oak leaf to it, which, being pulled down,
  would show when he had a bite. These alders loomed through the mist at regular
  intervals as you walked half way round the pond.</p>

  <p>Ah, the pickerel of Walden! when I see them lying on the ice, or in the well which
  the fisherman cuts in the ice, making a little hole to admit the water, I am always
  surprised by their rare beauty, as if they were fabulous fishes, they are so foreign to
  the streets, even to the woods, foreign as Arabia to our Concord life. They possess a
  quite dazzling and transcendent beauty which separates them by a wide interval from the
  cadaverous cod and haddock whose fame is trumpeted in our streets. They are not green
  like the pines, nor gray like the stones, nor blue like the sky; but they have, to my
  eyes, if possible, yet rarer colors, like flowers and precious stones, as if they were
  the pearls, the animalized nuclei or crystals of the Walden water. They, of course, are
  Walden all over and all through; are themselves small Waldens in the animal kingdom,
  Waldenses. It is surprising that they are caught here&#8212;that in this deep and
  capacious spring, far beneath the rattling teams and chaises and tinkling sleighs that
  travel the Walden road, this great gold and emerald fish swims. I never chanced to see
  its kind in any market; it would be the cynosure of all eyes there. Easily, with a few
  convulsive quirks, they give up their watery ghosts, like a mortal translated before
  his time to the thin air of heaven.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>As I was desirous to recover the long lost bottom of Walden Pond, I surveyed it
  carefully, before the ice broke up, early in '46, with compass and chain and sounding
  line. There have been many stories told about the bottom, or rather no bottom, of this
  pond, which certainly had no foundation for themselves. It is remarkable how long men
  will believe in the bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble to sound it. I
  have visited two such Bottomless Ponds in one walk in this neighborhood. Many have
  believed that Walden reached quite through to the other side of the globe. Some who
  have lain flat on the ice for a long time, looking down through the illusive medium,
  perchance with watery eyes into the bargain, and driven to hasty conclusions by the
  fear of catching cold in their breasts, have seen vast holes "into which a load of hay
  might be driven," if there were anybody to drive it, the undoubted source of the Styx
  and entrance to the Infernal Regions from these parts. Others have gone down from the
  village with a "fifty-six" and a wagon load of inch rope, but yet have failed to find
  any bottom; for while the "fifty-six" was resting by the way, they were paying out the
  rope in the vain attempt to fathom their truly immeasurable capacity for
  marvellousness. But I can assure my readers that Walden has a reasonably tight bottom
  at a not unreasonable, though at an unusual, depth. I fathomed it easily with a
  cod-line and a stone weighing about a pound and a half, and could tell accurately when
  the stone left the bottom, by having to pull so much harder before the water got
  underneath to help me. The greatest depth was exactly one hundred and two feet; to
  which may be added the five feet which it has risen since, making one hundred and
  seven. This is a remarkable depth for so small an area; yet not an inch of it can be
  spared by the imagination. What if all ponds were shallow? Would it not react on the
  minds of men? I am thankful that this pond was made deep and pure for a symbol. While
  men believe in the infinite some ponds will be thought to be bottomless.</p>

  <p>A factory-owner, hearing what depth I had found, thought that it could not be true,
  for, judging from his acquaintance with dams, sand would not lie at so steep an angle.
  But the deepest ponds are not so deep in proportion to their area as most suppose, and,
  if drained, would not leave very remarkable valleys. They are not like cups between the
  hills; for this one, which is so unusually deep for its area, appears in a vertical
  section through its centre not deeper than a shallow plate. Most ponds, emptied, would
  leave a meadow no more hollow than we frequently see. William Gilpin, who is so
  admirable in all that relates to landscapes, and usually so correct, standing at the
  head of Loch Fyne, in Scotland, which he describes as "a bay of salt water, sixty or
  seventy fathoms deep, four miles in breadth," and about fifty miles long, surrounded by
  mountains, observes, "If we could have seen it immediately after the diluvian crash, or
  whatever convulsion of nature occasioned it, before the waters gushed in, what a horrid
  chasm must it have appeared!</p>
  <pre>            "So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low
             Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,
             Capacious bed of waters."
</pre>

  <p class="nind">But if, using the shortest diameter of Loch Fyne, we apply these
  proportions to Walden, which, as we have seen, appears already in a vertical section
  only like a shallow plate, it will appear four times as shallow. So much for the
  increased horrors of the chasm of Loch Fyne when emptied. No doubt many a smiling
  valley with its stretching cornfields occupies exactly such a "horrid chasm," from
  which the waters have receded, though it requires the insight and the far sight of the
  geologist to convince the unsuspecting inhabitants of this fact. Often an inquisitive
  eye may detect the shores of a primitive lake in the low horizon hills, and no
  subsequent elevation of the plain have been necessary to conceal their history. But it
  is easiest, as they who work on the highways know, to find the hollows by the puddles
  after a shower. The amount of it is, the imagination give it the least license, dives
  deeper and soars higher than Nature goes. So, probably, the depth of the ocean will be
  found to be very inconsiderable compared with its breadth.</p>

  <p>As I sounded through the ice I could determine the shape of the bottom with greater
  accuracy than is possible in surveying harbors which do not freeze over, and I was
  surprised at its general regularity. In the deepest part there are several acres more
  level than almost any field which is exposed to the sun, wind, and plow. In one
  instance, on a line arbitrarily chosen, the depth did not vary more than one foot in
  thirty rods; and generally, near the middle, I could calculate the variation for each
  one hundred feet in any direction beforehand within three or four inches. Some are
  accustomed to speak of deep and dangerous holes even in quiet sandy ponds like this,
  but the effect of water under these circumstances is to level all inequalities. The
  regularity of the bottom and its conformity to the shores and the range of the
  neighboring hills were so perfect that a distant promontory betrayed itself in the
  soundings quite across the pond, and its direction could be determined by observing the
  opposite shore. Cape becomes bar, and plain shoal, and valley and gorge deep water and
  channel.</p>

  <p>When I had mapped the pond by the scale of ten rods to an inch, and put down the
  soundings, more than a hundred in all, I observed this remarkable coincidence. Having
  noticed that the number indicating the greatest depth was apparently in the centre of
  the map, I laid a rule on the map lengthwise, and then breadthwise, and found, to my
  surprise, that the line of greatest length intersected the line of greatest breadth
  <i>exactly</i> at the point of greatest depth, notwithstanding that the middle is so
  nearly level, the outline of the pond far from regular, and the extreme length and
  breadth were got by measuring into the coves; and I said to myself, Who knows but this
  hint would conduct to the deepest part of the ocean as well as of a pond or puddle? Is
  not this the rule also for the height of mountains, regarded as the opposite of
  valleys? We know that a hill is not highest at its narrowest part.</p>

  <p>Of five coves, three, or all which had been sounded, were observed to have a bar
  quite across their mouths and deeper water within, so that the bay tended to be an
  expansion of water within the land not only horizontally but vertically, and to form a
  basin or independent pond, the direction of the two capes showing the course of the
  bar. Every harbor on the sea-coast, also, has its bar at its entrance. In proportion as
  the mouth of the cove was wider compared with its length, the water over the bar was
  deeper compared with that in the basin. Given, then, the length and breadth of the
  cove, and the character of the surrounding shore, and you have almost elements enough
  to make out a formula for all cases.</p>

  <p>In order to see how nearly I could guess, with this experience, at the deepest point
  in a pond, by observing the outlines of a surface and the character of its shores
  alone, I made a plan of White Pond, which contains about forty-one acres, and, like
  this, has no island in it, nor any visible inlet or outlet; and as the line of greatest
  breadth fell very near the line of least breadth, where two opposite capes approached
  each other and two opposite bays receded, I ventured to mark a point a short distance
  from the latter line, but still on the line of greatest length, as the deepest. The
  deepest part was found to be within one hundred feet of this, still farther in the
  direction to which I had inclined, and was only one foot deeper, namely, sixty feet. Of
  course, a stream running through, or an island in the pond, would make the problem much
  more complicated.</p>

  <p>If we knew all the laws of Nature, we should need only one fact, or the description
  of one actual phenomenon, to infer all the particular results at that point. Now we
  know only a few laws, and our result is vitiated, not, of course, by any confusion or
  irregularity in Nature, but by our ignorance of essential elements in the calculation.
  Our notions of law and harmony are commonly confined to those instances which we
  detect; but the harmony which results from a far greater number of seemingly
  conflicting, but really concurring, laws, which we have not detected, is still more
  wonderful. The particular laws are as our points of view, as, to the traveller, a
  mountain outline varies with every step, and it has an infinite number of profiles,
  though absolutely but one form. Even when cleft or bored through it is not comprehended
  in its entireness.</p>

  <p>What I have observed of the pond is no less true in ethics. It is the law of
  average. Such a rule of the two diameters not only guides us toward the sun in the
  system and the heart in man, but draws lines through the length and breadth of the
  aggregate of a man's particular daily behaviors and waves of life into his coves and
  inlets, and where they intersect will be the height or depth of his character. Perhaps
  we need only to know how his shores trend and his adjacent country or circumstances, to
  infer his depth and concealed bottom. If he is surrounded by mountainous circumstances,
  an Achillean shore, whose peaks overshadow and are reflected in his bosom, they suggest
  a corresponding depth in him. But a low and smooth shore proves him shallow on that
  side. In our bodies, a bold projecting brow falls off to and indicates a corresponding
  depth of thought. Also there is a bar across the entrance of our every cove, or
  particular inclination; each is our harbor for a season, in which we are detained and
  partially land-locked. These inclinations are not whimsical usually, but their form,
  size, and direction are determined by the promontories of the shore, the ancient axes
  of elevation. When this bar is gradually increased by storms, tides, or currents, or
  there is a subsidence of the waters, so that it reaches to the surface, that which was
  at first but an inclination in the shore in which a thought was harbored becomes an
  individual lake, cut off from the ocean, wherein the thought secures its own
  conditions&#8212;changes, perhaps, from salt to fresh, becomes a sweet sea, dead sea,
  or a marsh. At the advent of each individual into this life, may we not suppose that
  such a bar has risen to the surface somewhere? It is true, we are such poor navigators
  that our thoughts, for the most part, stand off and on upon a harborless coast, are
  conversant only with the bights of the bays of poesy, or steer for the public ports of
  entry, and go into the dry docks of science, where they merely refit for this world,
  and no natural currents concur to individualize them.</p>

  <p>As for the inlet or outlet of Walden, I have not discovered any but rain and snow
  and evaporation, though perhaps, with a thermometer and a line, such places may be
  found, for where the water flows into the pond it will probably be coldest in summer
  and warmest in winter. When the ice-men were at work here in '46-7, the cakes sent to
  the shore were one day rejected by those who were stacking them up there, not being
  thick enough to lie side by side with the rest; and the cutters thus discovered that
  the ice over a small space was two or three inches thinner than elsewhere, which made
  them think that there was an inlet there. They also showed me in another place what
  they thought was a "leach-hole," through which the pond leaked out under a hill into a
  neighboring meadow, pushing me out on a cake of ice to see it. It was a small cavity
  under ten feet of water; but I think that I can warrant the pond not to need soldering
  till they find a worse leak than that. One has suggested, that if such a "leach-hole"
  should be found, its connection with the meadow, if any existed, might be proved by
  conveying some colored powder or sawdust to the mouth of the hole, and then putting a
  strainer over the spring in the meadow, which would catch some of the particles carried
  through by the current.</p>

  <p>While I was surveying, the ice, which was sixteen inches thick, undulated under a
  slight wind like water. It is well known that a level cannot be used on ice. At one rod
  from the shore its greatest fluctuation, when observed by means of a level on land
  directed toward a graduated staff on the ice, was three quarters of an inch, though the
  ice appeared firmly attached to the shore. It was probably greater in the middle. Who
  knows but if our instruments were delicate enough we might detect an undulation in the
  crust of the earth? When two legs of my level were on the shore and the third on the
  ice, and the sights were directed over the latter, a rise or fall of the ice of an
  almost infinitesimal amount made a difference of several feet on a tree across the
  pond. When I began to cut holes for sounding there were three or four inches of water
  on the ice under a deep snow which had sunk it thus far; but the water began
  immediately to run into these holes, and continued to run for two days in deep streams,
  which wore away the ice on every side, and contributed essentially, if not mainly, to
  dry the surface of the pond; for, as the water ran in, it raised and floated the ice.
  This was somewhat like cutting a hole in the bottom of a ship to let the water out.
  When such holes freeze, and a rain succeeds, and finally a new freezing forms a fresh
  smooth ice over all, it is beautifully mottled internally by dark figures, shaped
  somewhat like a spider's web, what you may call ice rosettes, produced by the channels
  worn by the water flowing from all sides to a centre. Sometimes, also, when the ice was
  covered with shallow puddles, I saw a double shadow of myself, one standing on the head
  of the other, one on the ice, the other on the trees or hillside.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>While yet it is cold January, and snow and ice are thick and solid, the prudent
  landlord comes from the village to get ice to cool his summer drink; impressively, even
  pathetically, wise, to foresee the heat and thirst of July now in January&#8212;wearing
  a thick coat and mittens! when so many things are not provided for. It may be that he
  lays up no treasures in this world which will cool his summer drink in the next. He
  cuts and saws the solid pond, unroofs the house of fishes, and carts off their very
  element and air, held fast by chains and stakes like corded wood, through the favoring
  winter air, to wintry cellars, to underlie the summer there. It looks like solidified
  azure, as, far off, it is drawn through the streets. These ice-cutters are a merry
  race, full of jest and sport, and when I went among them they were wont to invite me to
  saw pit-fashion with them, I standing underneath.</p>

  <p>In the winter of '46-7 there came a hundred men of Hyperborean extraction swoop down
  on to our pond one morning, with many carloads of ungainly-looking farming
  tools&#8212;sleds, plows, drill-barrows, turf-knives, spades, saws, rakes, and each man
  was armed with a double-pointed pike-staff, such as is not described in the New-England
  Farmer or the Cultivator. I did not know whether they had come to sow a crop of winter
  rye, or some other kind of grain recently introduced from Iceland. As I saw no manure,
  I judged that they meant to skim the land, as I had done, thinking the soil was deep
  and had lain fallow long enough. They said that a gentleman farmer, who was behind the
  scenes, wanted to double his money, which, as I understood, amounted to half a million
  already; but in order to cover each one of his dollars with another, he took off the
  only coat, ay, the skin itself, of Walden Pond in the midst of a hard winter. They went
  to work at once, plowing, barrowing, rolling, furrowing, in admirable order, as if they
  were bent on making this a model farm; but when I was looking sharp to see what kind of
  seed they dropped into the furrow, a gang of fellows by my side suddenly began to hook
  up the virgin mould itself, with a peculiar jerk, clean down to the sand, or rather the
  water&#8212;for it was a very springy soil&#8212;indeed all the <i>terra firma</i>
  there was&#8212;and haul it away on sleds, and then I guessed that they must be cutting
  peat in a bog. So they came and went every day, with a peculiar shriek from the
  locomotive, from and to some point of the polar regions, as it seemed to me, like a
  flock of arctic snow-birds. But sometimes Squaw Walden had her revenge, and a hired
  man, walking behind his team, slipped through a crack in the ground down toward
  Tartarus, and he who was so brave before suddenly became but the ninth part of a man,
  almost gave up his animal heat, and was glad to take refuge in my house, and
  acknowledged that there was some virtue in a stove; or sometimes the frozen soil took a
  piece of steel out of a plowshare, or a plow got set in the furrow and had to be cut
  out.</p>

  <p>To speak literally, a hundred Irishmen, with Yankee overseers, came from Cambridge
  every day to get out the ice. They divided it into cakes by methods too well known to
  require description, and these, being sledded to the shore, were rapidly hauled off on
  to an ice platform, and raised by grappling irons and block and tackle, worked by
  horses, on to a stack, as surely as so many barrels of flour, and there placed evenly
  side by side, and row upon row, as if they formed the solid base of an obelisk designed
  to pierce the clouds. They told me that in a good day they could get out a thousand
  tons, which was the yield of about one acre. Deep ruts and "cradle-holes" were worn in
  the ice, as on <i>terra firma</i>, by the passage of the sleds over the same track, and
  the horses invariably ate their oats out of cakes of ice hollowed out like buckets.
  They stacked up the cakes thus in the open air in a pile thirty-five feet high on one
  side and six or seven rods square, putting hay between the outside layers to exclude
  the air; for when the wind, though never so cold, finds a passage through, it will wear
  large cavities, leaving slight supports or studs only here and there, and finally
  topple it down. At first it looked like a vast blue fort or Valhalla; but when they
  began to tuck the coarse meadow hay into the crevices, and this became covered with
  rime and icicles, it looked like a venerable moss-grown and hoary ruin, built of
  azure-tinted marble, the abode of Winter, that old man we see in the almanac&#8212;his
  shanty, as if he had a design to estivate with us. They calculated that not twenty-five
  per cent of this would reach its destination, and that two or three per cent would be
  wasted in the cars. However, a still greater part of this heap had a different destiny
  from what was intended; for, either because the ice was found not to keep so well as
  was expected, containing more air than usual, or for some other reason, it never got to
  market. This heap, made in the winter of '46-7 and estimated to contain ten thousand
  tons, was finally covered with hay and boards; and though it was unroofed the following
  July, and a part of it carried off, the rest remaining exposed to the sun, it stood
  over that summer and the next winter, and was not quite melted till September, 1848.
  Thus the pond recovered the greater part.</p>

  <p>Like the water, the Walden ice, seen near at hand, has a green tint, but at a
  distance is beautifully blue, and you can easily tell it from the white ice of the
  river, or the merely greenish ice of some ponds, a quarter of a mile off. Sometimes one
  of those great cakes slips from the ice-man's sled into the village street, and lies
  there for a week like a great emerald, an object of interest to all passers. I have
  noticed that a portion of Walden which in the state of water was green will often, when
  frozen, appear from the same point of view blue. So the hollows about this pond will,
  sometimes, in the winter, be filled with a greenish water somewhat like its own, but
  the next day will have frozen blue. Perhaps the blue color of water and ice is due to
  the light and air they contain, and the most transparent is the bluest. Ice is an
  interesting subject for contemplation. They told me that they had some in the
  ice-houses at Fresh Pond five years old which was as good as ever. Why is it that a
  bucket of water soon becomes putrid, but frozen remains sweet forever? It is commonly
  said that this is the difference between the affections and the intellect.</p>

  <p>Thus for sixteen days I saw from my window a hundred men at work like busy
  husbandmen, with teams and horses and apparently all the implements of farming, such a
  picture as we see on the first page of the almanac; and as often as I looked out I was
  reminded of the fable of the lark and the reapers, or the parable of the sower, and the
  like; and now they are all gone, and in thirty days more, probably, I shall look from
  the same window on the pure sea-green Walden water there, reflecting the clouds and the
  trees, and sending up its evaporations in solitude, and no traces will appear that a
  man has ever stood there. Perhaps I shall hear a solitary loon laugh as he dives and
  plumes himself, or shall see a lonely fisher in his boat, like a floating leaf,
  beholding his form reflected in the waves, where lately a hundred men securely
  labored.</p>

  <p>Thus it appears that the sweltering inhabitants of Charleston and New Orleans, of
  Madras and Bombay and Calcutta, drink at my well. In the morning I bathe my intellect
  in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat-Geeta, since whose
  composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern
  world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not
  to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our
  conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! there I meet the
  servant of the Bramin, priest of Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his
  temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust
  and water jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as
  it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the
  sacred water of the Ganges. With favoring winds it is wafted past the site of the
  fabulous islands of Atlantis and the Hesperides, makes the periplus of Hanno, and,
  floating by Ternate and Tidore and the mouth of the Persian Gulf, melts in the tropic
  gales of the Indian seas, and is landed in ports of which Alexander only heard the
  names.</p>

  <h2>Spring</h2>

  <p>The opening of large tracts by the ice-cutters commonly causes a pond to break up
  earlier; for the water, agitated by the wind, even in cold weather, wears away the
  surrounding ice. But such was not the effect on Walden that year, for she had soon got
  a thick new garment to take the place of the old. This pond never breaks up so soon as
  the others in this neighborhood, on account both of its greater depth and its having no
  stream passing through it to melt or wear away the ice. I never knew it to open in the
  course of a winter, not excepting that of '52-3, which gave the ponds so severe a
  trial. It commonly opens about the first of April, a week or ten days later than
  Flint's Pond and Fair Haven, beginning to melt on the north side and in the shallower
  parts where it began to freeze. It indicates better than any water hereabouts the
  absolute progress of the season, being least affected by transient changes of
  temperature. A severe cold of a few days' duration in March may very much retard the
  opening of the former ponds, while the temperature of Walden increases almost
  uninterruptedly. A thermometer thrust into the middle of Walden on the 6th of March,
  1847, stood at 32&#176;, or freezing point; near the shore at 33&#176;; in the middle of
  Flint's Pond, the same day, at 32&#189;&#176;; at a dozen rods from the shore, in
  shallow water, under ice a foot thick, at 36&#176;. This difference of three and a half
  degrees between the temperature of the deep water and the shallow in the latter pond,
  and the fact that a great proportion of it is comparatively shallow, show why it should
  break up so much sooner than Walden. The ice in the shallowest part was at this time
  several inches thinner than in the middle. In midwinter the middle had been the warmest
  and the ice thinnest there. So, also, every one who has waded about the shores of the
  pond in summer must have perceived how much warmer the water is close to the shore,
  where only three or four inches deep, than a little distance out, and on the surface
  where it is deep, than near the bottom. In spring the sun not only exerts an influence
  through the increased temperature of the air and earth, but its heat passes through ice
  a foot or more thick, and is reflected from the bottom in shallow water, and so also
  warms the water and melts the under side of the ice, at the same time that it is
  melting it more directly above, making it uneven, and causing the air bubbles which it
  contains to extend themselves upward and downward until it is completely honeycombed,
  and at last disappears suddenly in a single spring rain. Ice has its grain as well as
  wood, and when a cake begins to rot or "comb," that is, assume the appearance of
  honeycomb, whatever may be its position, the air cells are at right angles with what
  was the water surface. Where there is a rock or a log rising near to the surface the
  ice over it is much thinner, and is frequently quite dissolved by this reflected heat;
  and I have been told that in the experiment at Cambridge to freeze water in a shallow
  wooden pond, though the cold air circulated underneath, and so had access to both
  sides, the reflection of the sun from the bottom more than counterbalanced this
  advantage. When a warm rain in the middle of the winter melts off the snow-ice from
  Walden, and leaves a hard dark or transparent ice on the middle, there will be a strip
  of rotten though thicker white ice, a rod or more wide, about the shores, created by
  this reflected heat. Also, as I have said, the bubbles themselves within the ice
  operate as burning-glasses to melt the ice beneath.</p>

  <p>The phenomena of the year take place every day in a pond on a small scale. Every
  morning, generally speaking, the shallow water is being warmed more rapidly than the
  deep, though it may not be made so warm after all, and every evening it is being cooled
  more rapidly until the morning. The day is an epitome of the year. The night is the
  winter, the morning and evening are the spring and fall, and the noon is the summer.
  The cracking and booming of the ice indicate a change of temperature. One pleasant
  morning after a cold night, February 24th, 1850, having gone to Flint's Pond to spend
  the day, I noticed with surprise, that when I struck the ice with the head of my axe,
  it resounded like a gong for many rods around, or as if I had struck on a tight
  drum-head. The pond began to boom about an hour after sunrise, when it felt the
  influence of the sun's rays slanted upon it from over the hills; it stretched itself
  and yawned like a waking man with a gradually increasing tumult, which was kept up
  three or four hours. It took a short siesta at noon, and boomed once more toward night,
  as the sun was withdrawing his influence. In the right stage of the weather a pond
  fires its evening gun with great regularity. But in the middle of the day, being full
  of cracks, and the air also being less elastic, it had completely lost its resonance,
  and probably fishes and muskrats could not then have been stunned by a blow on it. The
  fishermen say that the "thundering of the pond" scares the fishes and prevents their
  biting. The pond does not thunder every evening, and I cannot tell surely when to
  expect its thundering; but though I may perceive no difference in the weather, it does.
  Who would have suspected so large and cold and thick-skinned a thing to be so
  sensitive? Yet it has its law to which it thunders obedience when it should as surely
  as the buds expand in the spring. The earth is all alive and covered with papillae. The
  largest pond is as sensitive to atmospheric changes as the globule of mercury in its
  tube.</p>

  <p>One attraction in coming to the woods to live was that I should have leisure and
  opportunity to see the Spring come in. The ice in the pond at length begins to be
  honeycombed, and I can set my heel in it as I walk. Fogs and rains and warmer suns are
  gradually melting the snow; the days have grown sensibly longer; and I see how I shall
  get through the winter without adding to my wood-pile, for large fires are no longer
  necessary. I am on the alert for the first signs of spring, to hear the chance note of
  some arriving bird, or the striped squirrel's chirp, for his stores must be now nearly
  exhausted, or see the woodchuck venture out of his winter quarters. On the 13th of
  March, after I had heard the bluebird, song sparrow, and red-wing, the ice was still
  nearly a foot thick. As the weather grew warmer it was not sensibly worn away by the
  water, nor broken up and floated off as in rivers, but, though it was completely melted
  for half a rod in width about the shore, the middle was merely honeycombed and
  saturated with water, so that you could put your foot through it when six inches thick;
  but by the next day evening, perhaps, after a warm rain followed by fog, it would have
  wholly disappeared, all gone off with the fog, spirited away. One year I went across
  the middle only five days before it disappeared entirely. In 1845 Walden was first
  completely open on the 1st of April; in '46, the 25th of March; in '47, the 8th of
  April; in '51, the 28th of March; in '52, the 18th of April; in '53, the 23d of March;
  in '54, about the 7th of April.</p>

  <p>Every incident connected with the breaking up of the rivers and ponds and the
  settling of the weather is particularly interesting to us who live in a climate of so
  great extremes. When the warmer days come, they who dwell near the river hear the ice
  crack at night with a startling whoop as loud as artillery, as if its icy fetters were
  rent from end to end, and within a few days see it rapidly going out. So the alligator
  comes out of the mud with quakings of the earth. One old man, who has been a close
  observer of Nature, and seems as thoroughly wise in regard to all her operations as if
  she had been put upon the stocks when he was a boy, and he had helped to lay her
  keel&#8212;who has come to his growth, and can hardly acquire more of natural lore if
  he should live to the age of Methuselah&#8212;told me&#8212;and I was surprised to hear
  him express wonder at any of Nature's operations, for I thought that there were no
  secrets between them&#8212;that one spring day he took his gun and boat, and thought
  that he would have a little sport with the ducks. There was ice still on the meadows,
  but it was all gone out of the river, and he dropped down without obstruction from
  Sudbury, where he lived, to Fair Haven Pond, which he found, unexpectedly, covered for
  the most part with a firm field of ice. It was a warm day, and he was surprised to see
  so great a body of ice remaining. Not seeing any ducks, he hid his boat on the north or
  back side of an island in the pond, and then concealed himself in the bushes on the
  south side, to await them. The ice was melted for three or four rods from the shore,
  and there was a smooth and warm sheet of water, with a muddy bottom, such as the ducks
  love, within, and he thought it likely that some would be along pretty soon. After he
  had lain still there about an hour he heard a low and seemingly very distant sound, but
  singularly grand and impressive, unlike anything he had ever heard, gradually swelling
  and increasing as if it would have a universal and memorable ending, a sullen rush and
  roar, which seemed to him all at once like the sound of a vast body of fowl coming in
  to settle there, and, seizing his gun, he started up in haste and excited; but he
  found, to his surprise, that the whole body of the ice had started while he lay there,
  and drifted in to the shore, and the sound he had heard was made by its edge grating on
  the shore&#8212;at first gently nibbled and crumbled off, but at length heaving up and
  scattering its wrecks along the island to a considerable height before it came to a
  standstill.</p>

  <p>At length the sun's rays have attained the right angle, and warm winds blow up mist
  and rain and melt the snowbanks, and the sun, dispersing the mist, smiles on a
  checkered landscape of russet and white smoking with incense, through which the
  traveller picks his way from islet to islet, cheered by the music of a thousand
  tinkling rills and rivulets whose veins are filled with the blood of winter which they
  are bearing off.</p>

  <p>Few phenomena gave me more delight than to observe the forms which thawing sand and
  clay assume in flowing down the sides of a deep cut on the railroad through which I
  passed on my way to the village, a phenomenon not very common on so large a scale,
  though the number of freshly exposed banks of the right material must have been greatly
  multiplied since railroads were invented. The material was sand of every degree of
  fineness and of various rich colors, commonly mixed with a little clay. When the frost
  comes out in the spring, and even in a thawing day in the winter, the sand begins to
  flow down the slopes like lava, sometimes bursting out through the snow and overflowing
  it where no sand was to be seen before. Innumerable little streams overlap and
  interlace one with another, exhibiting a sort of hybrid product, which obeys half way
  the law of currents, and half way that of vegetation. As it flows it takes the forms of
  sappy leaves or vines, making heaps of pulpy sprays a foot or more in depth, and
  resembling, as you look down on them, the laciniated, lobed, and imbricated thalluses
  of some lichens; or you are reminded of coral, of leopard's paws or birds' feet, of
  brains or lungs or bowels, and excrements of all kinds. It is a truly <i>grotesque</i>
  vegetation, whose forms and color we see imitated in bronze, a sort of architectural
  foliage more ancient and typical than acanthus, chiccory, ivy, vine, or any vegetable
  leaves; destined perhaps, under some circumstances, to become a puzzle to future
  geologists. The whole cut impressed me as if it were a cave with its stalactites laid
  open to the light. The various shades of the sand are singularly rich and agreeable,
  embracing the different iron colors, brown, gray, yellowish, and reddish. When the
  flowing mass reaches the drain at the foot of the bank it spreads out flatter into
  <i>strands</i>, the separate streams losing their semi-cylindrical form and gradually
  becoming more flat and broad, running together as they are more moist, till they form
  an almost flat <i>sand</i>, still variously and beautifully shaded, but in which you
  can trace the original forms of vegetation; till at length, in the water itself, they
  are converted into <i>banks</i>, like those formed off the mouths of rivers, and the
  forms of vegetation are lost in the ripple marks on the bottom.</p>

  <p>The whole bank, which is from twenty to forty feet high, is sometimes overlaid with
  a mass of this kind of foliage, or sandy rupture, for a quarter of a mile on one or
  both sides, the produce of one spring day. What makes this sand foliage remarkable is
  its springing into existence thus suddenly. When I see on the one side the inert
  bank&#8212;for the sun acts on one side first&#8212;and on the other this luxuriant
  foliage, the creation of an hour, I am affected as if in a peculiar sense I stood in
  the laboratory of the Artist who made the world and me&#8212;had come to where he was
  still at work, sporting on this bank, and with excess of energy strewing his fresh
  designs about. I feel as if I were nearer to the vitals of the globe, for this sandy
  overflow is something such a foliaceous mass as the vitals of the animal body. You find
  thus in the very sands an anticipation of the vegetable leaf. No wonder that the earth
  expresses itself outwardly in leaves, it so labors with the idea inwardly. The atoms
  have already learned this law, and are pregnant by it. The overhanging leaf sees here
  its prototype. <i>Internally</i>, whether in the globe or animal body, it is a moist
  thick <i>lobe</i>, a word especially applicable to the liver and lungs and the leaves
  of fat (<span title="gehib&#244;">&#947;&#949;&#7985;&#946;&#969;</span>,
  <i>labor</i>, <i>lapsus</i>, to flow or slip downward, a lapsing; <span title="lobhos">&#955;&#959;&#946;&#8001;&#962;</span>, <i>globus</i>, lobe, globe;
  also lap, flap, and many other words); <i>externally</i> a dry thin <i>leaf</i>, even
  as the <i>f</i> and <i>v</i> are a pressed and dried <i>b</i>. The radicals of
  <i>lobe</i> are <i>lb</i>, the soft mass of the <i>b</i> (single lobed, or B, double
  lobed), with the liquid <i>l</i> behind it pressing it forward. In globe, <i>glb</i>,
  the guttural <i>g</i> adds to the meaning the capacity of the throat. The feathers and
  wings of birds are still drier and thinner leaves. Thus, also, you pass from the
  lumpish grub in the earth to the airy and fluttering butterfly. The very globe
  continually transcends and translates itself, and becomes winged in its orbit. Even ice
  begins with delicate crystal leaves, as if it had flowed into moulds which the fronds
  of waterplants have impressed on the watery mirror. The whole tree itself is but one
  leaf, and rivers are still vaster leaves whose pulp is intervening earth, and towns and
  cities are the ova of insects in their axils.</p>

  <p>When the sun withdraws the sand ceases to flow, but in the morning the streams will
  start once more and branch and branch again into a myriad of others. You here see
  perchance how blood-vessels are formed. If you look closely you observe that first
  there pushes forward from the thawing mass a stream of softened sand with a drop-like
  point, like the ball of the finger, feeling its way slowly and blindly downward, until
  at last with more heat and moisture, as the sun gets higher, the most fluid portion, in
  its effort to obey the law to which the most inert also yields, separates from the
  latter and forms for itself a meandering channel or artery within that, in which is
  seen a little silvery stream glancing like lightning from one stage of pulpy leaves or
  branches to another, and ever and anon swallowed up in the sand. It is wonderful how
  rapidly yet perfectly the sand organizes itself as it flows, using the best material
  its mass affords to form the sharp edges of its channel. Such are the sources of
  rivers. In the silicious matter which the water deposits is perhaps the bony system,
  and in the still finer soil and organic matter the fleshy fibre or cellular tissue.
  What is man but a mass of thawing clay? The ball of the human finger is but a drop
  congealed. The fingers and toes flow to their extent from the thawing mass of the body.
  Who knows what the human body would expand and flow out to under a more genial heaven?
  Is not the hand a spreading <i>palm</i> leaf with its lobes and veins? The ear may be
  regarded, fancifully, as a lichen, <i>Umbilicaria</i>, on the side of the head, with
  its lobe or drop. The lip&#8212;<i>labium</i>, from <i>labor</i> (?)&#8212;laps or
  lapses from the sides of the cavernous mouth. The nose is a manifest congealed drop or
  stalactite. The chin is a still larger drop, the confluent dripping of the face. The
  cheeks are a slide from the brows into the valley of the face, opposed and diffused by
  the cheek bones. Each rounded lobe of the vegetable leaf, too, is a thick and now
  loitering drop, larger or smaller; the lobes are the fingers of the leaf; and as many
  lobes as it has, in so many directions it tends to flow, and more heat or other genial
  influences would have caused it to flow yet farther.</p>

  <p>Thus it seemed that this one hillside illustrated the principle of all the
  operations of Nature. The Maker of this earth but patented a leaf. What Champollion
  will decipher this hieroglyphic for us, that we may turn over a new leaf at last? This
  phenomenon is more exhilarating to me than the luxuriance and fertility of vineyards.
  True, it is somewhat excrementitious in its character, and there is no end to the heaps
  of liver, lights, and bowels, as if the globe were turned wrong side outward; but this
  suggests at least that Nature has some bowels, and there again is mother of humanity.
  This is the frost coming out of the ground; this is Spring. It precedes the green and
  flowery spring, as mythology precedes regular poetry. I know of nothing more purgative
  of winter fumes and indigestions. It convinces me that Earth is still in her
  swaddling-clothes, and stretches forth baby fingers on every side. Fresh curls spring
  from the baldest brow. There is nothing inorganic. These foliaceous heaps lie along the
  bank like the slag of a furnace, showing that Nature is "in full blast" within. The
  earth is not a mere fragment of dead history, stratum upon stratum like the leaves of a
  book, to be studied by geologists and antiquaries chiefly, but living poetry like the
  leaves of a tree, which precede flowers and fruit&#8212;not a fossil earth, but a
  living earth; compared with whose great central life all animal and vegetable life is
  merely parasitic. Its throes will heave our exuviae from their graves. You may melt
  your metals and cast them into the most beautiful moulds you can; they will never
  excite me like the forms which this molten earth flows out into. And not only it, but
  the institutions upon it are plastic like clay in the hands of the potter.</p>

  <p>Ere long, not only on these banks, but on every hill and plain and in every hollow,
  the frost comes out of the ground like a dormant quadruped from its burrow, and seeks
  the sea with music, or migrates to other climes in clouds. Thaw with his gentle
  persuasion is more powerful than Thor with his hammer. The one melts, the other but
  breaks in pieces.</p>

  <p>When the ground was partially bare of snow, and a few warm days had dried its
  surface somewhat, it was pleasant to compare the first tender signs of the infant year
  just peeping forth with the stately beauty of the withered vegetation which had
  withstood the winter&#8212;life-everlasting, goldenrods, pinweeds, and graceful wild
  grasses, more obvious and interesting frequently than in summer even, as if their
  beauty was not ripe till then; even cotton-grass, cat-tails, mulleins, johnswort,
  hard-hack, meadow-sweet, and other strong-stemmed plants, those unexhausted granaries
  which entertain the earliest birds&#8212;decent weeds, at least, which widowed Nature
  wears. I am particularly attracted by the arching and sheaf-like top of the wool-grass;
  it brings back the summer to our winter memories, and is among the forms which art
  loves to copy, and which, in the vegetable kingdom, have the same relation to types
  already in the mind of man that astronomy has. It is an antique style, older than Greek
  or Egyptian. Many of the phenomena of Winter are suggestive of an inexpressible
  tenderness and fragile delicacy. We are accustomed to hear this king described as a
  rude and boisterous tyrant; but with the gentleness of a lover he adorns the tresses of
  Summer.</p>

  <p>At the approach of spring the red squirrels got under my house, two at a time,
  directly under my feet as I sat reading or writing, and kept up the queerest chuckling
  and chirruping and vocal pirouetting and gurgling sounds that ever were heard; and when
  I stamped they only chirruped the louder, as if past all fear and respect in their mad
  pranks, defying humanity to stop them. No, you don't&#8212;chickaree&#8212;chickaree.
  They were wholly deaf to my arguments, or failed to perceive their force, and fell into
  a strain of invective that was irresistible.</p>

  <p>The first sparrow of spring! The year beginning with younger hope than ever! The
  faint silvery warblings heard over the partially bare and moist fields from the
  bluebird, the song sparrow, and the red-wing, as if the last flakes of winter tinkled
  as they fell! What at such a time are histories, chronologies, traditions, and all
  written revelations? The brooks sing carols and glees to the spring. The marsh hawk,
  sailing low over the meadow, is already seeking the first slimy life that awakes. The
  sinking sound of melting snow is heard in all dells, and the ice dissolves apace in the
  ponds. The grass flames up on the hillsides like a spring fire&#8212;"et primitus
  oritur herba imbribus primoribus evocata"&#8212;as if the earth sent forth an inward
  heat to greet the returning sun; not yellow but green is the color of its
  flame;&#8212;the symbol of perpetual youth, the grass-blade, like a long green ribbon,
  streams from the sod into the summer, checked indeed by the frost, but anon pushing on
  again, lifting its spear of last year's hay with the fresh life below. It grows as
  steadily as the rill oozes out of the ground. It is almost identical with that, for in
  the growing days of June, when the rills are dry, the grass-blades are their channels,
  and from year to year the herds drink at this perennial green stream, and the mower
  draws from it betimes their winter supply. So our human life but dies down to its root,
  and still puts forth its green blade to eternity.</p>

  <p>Walden is melting apace. There is a canal two rods wide along the northerly and
  westerly sides, and wider still at the east end. A great field of ice has cracked off
  from the main body. I hear a song sparrow singing from the bushes on the
  shore,&#8212;<i>olit</i>, <i>olit</i>, <i>olit,</i>&#8212;<i>chip</i>, <i>chip</i>,
  <i>chip</i>, <i>che char</i>,&#8212;<i>che wiss</i>, <i>wiss</i>, <i>wiss</i>. He too
  is helping to crack it. How handsome the great sweeping curves in the edge of the ice,
  answering somewhat to those of the shore, but more regular! It is unusually hard, owing
  to the recent severe but transient cold, and all watered or waved like a palace floor.
  But the wind slides eastward over its opaque surface in vain, till it reaches the
  living surface beyond. It is glorious to behold this ribbon of water sparkling in the
  sun, the bare face of the pond full of glee and youth, as if it spoke the joy of the
  fishes within it, and of the sands on its shore&#8212;a silvery sheen as from the
  scales of a leuciscus, as it were all one active fish. Such is the contrast between
  winter and spring. Walden was dead and is alive again. But this spring it broke up more
  steadily, as I have said.</p>

  <p>The change from storm and winter to serene and mild weather, from dark and sluggish
  hours to bright and elastic ones, is a memorable crisis which all things proclaim. It
  is seemingly instantaneous at last. Suddenly an influx of light filled my house, though
  the evening was at hand, and the clouds of winter still overhung it, and the eaves were
  dripping with sleety rain. I looked out the window, and lo! where yesterday was cold
  gray ice there lay the transparent pond already calm and full of hope as in a summer
  evening, reflecting a summer evening sky in its bosom, though none was visible
  overhead, as if it had intelligence with some remote horizon. I heard a robin in the
  distance, the first I had heard for many a thousand years, methought, whose note I
  shall not forget for many a thousand more&#8212;the same sweet and powerful song as of
  yore. O the evening robin, at the end of a New England summer day! If I could ever find
  the twig he sits upon! I mean <i>he</i>; I mean the <i>twig</i>. This at least is not
  the <i>Turdus migratorius</i>. The pitch pines and shrub oaks about my house, which had
  so long drooped, suddenly resumed their several characters, looked brighter, greener,
  and more erect and alive, as if effectually cleansed and restored by the rain. I knew
  that it would not rain any more. You may tell by looking at any twig of the forest, ay,
  at your very wood-pile, whether its winter is past or not. As it grew darker, I was
  startled by the honking of geese flying low over the woods, like weary travellers
  getting in late from Southern lakes, and indulging at last in unrestrained complaint
  and mutual consolation. Standing at my door, I could hear the rush of their wings;
  when, driving toward my house, they suddenly spied my light, and with hushed clamor
  wheeled and settled in the pond. So I came in, and shut the door, and passed my first
  spring night in the woods.</p>

  <p>In the morning I watched the geese from the door through the mist, sailing in the
  middle of the pond, fifty rods off, so large and tumultuous that Walden appeared like
  an artificial pond for their amusement. But when I stood on the shore they at once rose
  up with a great flapping of wings at the signal of their commander, and when they had
  got into rank circled about over my head, twenty-nine of them, and then steered
  straight to Canada, with a regular <i>honk</i> from the leader at intervals, trusting
  to break their fast in muddier pools. A "plump" of ducks rose at the same time and took
  the route to the north in the wake of their noisier cousins.</p>

  <p>For a week I heard the circling, groping clangor of some solitary goose in the foggy
  mornings, seeking its companion, and still peopling the woods with the sound of a
  larger life than they could sustain. In April the pigeons were seen again flying
  express in small flocks, and in due time I heard the martins twittering over my
  clearing, though it had not seemed that the township contained so many that it could
  afford me any, and I fancied that they were peculiarly of the ancient race that dwelt
  in hollow trees ere white men came. In almost all climes the tortoise and the frog are
  among the precursors and heralds of this season, and birds fly with song and glancing
  plumage, and plants spring and bloom, and winds blow, to correct this slight
  oscillation of the poles and preserve the equilibrium of nature.</p>

  <p>As every season seems best to us in its turn, so the coming in of spring is like the
  creation of Cosmos out of Chaos and the realization of the Golden Age.&#8212;</p>
  <pre>  "Eurus ad Auroram Nabathaeaque regna recessit,

  <p class="nind">A single gentle rain makes the grass many shades greener. So our
  prospects brighten on the influx of better thoughts. We should be blessed if we lived
  in the present always, and took advantage of every accident that befell us, like the
  grass which confesses the influence of the slightest dew that falls on it; and did not
  spend our time in atoning for the neglect of past opportunities, which we call doing
  our duty. We loiter in winter while it is already spring. In a pleasant spring morning
  all men's sins are forgiven. Such a day is a truce to vice. While such a sun holds out
  to burn, the vilest sinner may return. Through our own recovered innocence we discern
  the innocence of our neighbors. You may have known your neighbor yesterday for a thief,
  a drunkard, or a sensualist, and merely pitied or despised him, and despaired of the
  world; but the sun shines bright and warm this first spring morning, recreating the
  world, and you meet him at some serene work, and see how it is exhausted and debauched
  veins expand with still joy and bless the new day, feel the spring influence with the
  innocence of infancy, and all his faults are forgotten. There is not only an atmosphere
  of good will about him, but even a savor of holiness groping for expression, blindly
  and ineffectually perhaps, like a new-born instinct, and for a short hour the south
  hill-side echoes to no vulgar jest. You see some innocent fair shoots preparing to
  burst from his gnarled rind and try another year's life, tender and fresh as the
  youngest plant. Even he has entered into the joy of his Lord. Why the jailer does not
  leave open his prison doors&#8212;why the judge does not dismis his case&#8212;why the
  preacher does not dismiss his congregation! It is because they do not obey the hint
  which God gives them, nor accept the pardon which he freely offers to all.</p>

  <p>"A return to goodness produced each day in the tranquil and beneficent breath of the
  morning, causes that in respect to the love of virtue and the hatred of vice, one
  approaches a little the primitive nature of man, as the sprouts of the forest which has
  been felled. In like manner the evil which one does in the interval of a day prevents
  the germs of virtues which began to spring up again from developing themselves and
  destroys them.</p>

  <p>"After the germs of virtue have thus been prevented many times from developing
  themselves, then the beneficent breath of evening does not suffice to preserve them. As
  soon as the breath of evening does not suffice longer to preserve them, then the nature
  of man does not differ much from that of the brute. Men seeing the nature of this man
  like that of the brute, think that he has never possessed the innate faculty of reason.
  Are those the true and natural sentiments of man?"</p>
  <pre>   "The Golden Age was first created, which without any avenger
    Spontaneously without law cherished fidelity and rectitude.
    Punishment and fear were not; nor were threatening words read
    On suspended brass; nor did the suppliant crowd fear
    The words of their judge; but were safe without an avenger.
    Not yet the pine felled on its mountains had descended
    To the liquid waves that it might see a foreign world,
    And mortals knew no shores but their own.
                          . . . . . . .
    There was eternal spring, and placid zephyrs with warm
    Blasts soothed the flowers born without seed."
</pre>

  <p>On the 29th of April, as I was fishing from the bank of the river near the
  Nine-Acre-Corner bridge, standing on the quaking grass and willow roots, where the
  muskrats lurk, I heard a singular rattling sound, somewhat like that of the sticks
  which boys play with their fingers, when, looking up, I observed a very slight and
  graceful hawk, like a nighthawk, alternately soaring like a ripple and tumbling a rod
  or two over and over, showing the under side of its wings, which gleamed like a satin
  ribbon in the sun, or like the pearly inside of a shell. This sight reminded me of
  falconry and what nobleness and poetry are associated with that sport. The Merlin it
  seemed to me it might be called: but I care not for its name. It was the most ethereal
  flight I had ever witnessed. It did not simply flutter like a butterfly, nor soar like
  the larger hawks, but it sported with proud reliance in the fields of air; mounting
  again and again with its strange chuckle, it repeated its free and beautiful fall,
  turning over and over like a kite, and then recovering from its lofty tumbling, as if
  it had never set its foot on <i>terra firma</i>. It appeared to have no companion in
  the universe&#8212;sporting there alone&#8212;and to need none but the morning and the
  ether with which it played. It was not lonely, but made all the earth lonely beneath
  it. Where was the parent which hatched it, its kindred, and its father in the heavens?
  The tenant of the air, it seemed related to the earth but by an egg hatched some time
  in the crevice of a crag;&#8212;or was its native nest made in the angle of a cloud,
  woven of the rainbow's trimmings and the sunset sky, and lined with some soft midsummer
  haze caught up from earth? Its eyry now some cliffy cloud.</p>

  <p>Beside this I got a rare mess of golden and silver and bright cupreous fishes, which
  looked like a string of jewels. Ah! I have penetrated to those meadows on the morning
  of many a first spring day, jumping from hummock to hummock, from willow root to willow
  root, when the wild river valley and the woods were bathed in so pure and bright a
  light as would have waked the dead, if they had been slumbering in their graves, as
  some suppose. There needs no stronger proof of immortality. All things must live in
  such a light. O Death, where was thy sting? O Grave, where was thy victory, then?</p>

  <p>Our village life would stagnate if it were not for the unexplored forests and
  meadows which surround it. We need the tonic of wildness&#8212;to wade sometimes in
  marshes where the bittern and the meadow-hen lurk, and hear the booming of the snipe;
  to smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds her
  nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close to the ground. At the same time that we
  are earnest to explore and learn all things, we require that all things be mysterious
  and unexplorable, that land and sea be infinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us
  because unfathomable. We can never have enough of nature. We must be refreshed by the
  sight of inexhaustible vigor, vast and titanic features, the sea-coast with its wrecks,
  the wilderness with its living and its decaying trees, the thunder-cloud, and the rain
  which lasts three weeks and produces freshets. We need to witness our own limits
  transgressed, and some life pasturing freely where we never wander. We are cheered when
  we observe the vulture feeding on the carrion which disgusts and disheartens us, and
  deriving health and strength from the repast. There was a dead horse in the hollow by
  the path to my house, which compelled me sometimes to go out of my way, especially in
  the night when the air was heavy, but the assurance it gave me of the strong appetite
  and inviolable health of Nature was my compensation for this. I love to see that Nature
  is so rife with life that myriads can be afforded to be sacrificed and suffered to prey
  on one another; that tender organizations can be so serenely squashed out of existence
  like pulp&#8212;tadpoles which herons gobble up, and tortoises and toads run over in
  the road; and that sometimes it has rained flesh and blood! With the liability to
  accident, we must see how little account is to be made of it. The impression made on a
  wise man is that of universal innocence. Poison is not poisonous after all, nor are any
  wounds fatal. Compassion is a very untenable ground. It must be expeditious. Its
  pleadings will not bear to be stereotyped.</p>

  <p>Early in May, the oaks, hickories, maples, and other trees, just putting out amidst
  the pine woods around the pond, imparted a brightness like sunshine to the landscape,
  especially in cloudy days, as if the sun were breaking through mists and shining
  faintly on the hillsides here and there. On the third or fourth of May I saw a loon in
  the pond, and during the first week of the month I heard the whip-poor-will, the brown
  thrasher, the veery, the wood pewee, the chewink, and other birds. I had heard the wood
  thrush long before. The ph&#339;be had already come once more and looked in at my door
  and window, to see if my house was cavern-like enough for her, sustaining herself on
  humming wings with clinched talons, as if she held by the air, while she surveyed the
  premises. The sulphur-like pollen of the pitch pine soon covered the pond and the
  stones and rotten wood along the shore, so that you could have collected a barrelful.
  This is the "sulphur showers" we hear of. Even in Calidas' drama of Sacontala, we read
  of "rills dyed yellow with the golden dust of the lotus." And so the seasons went
  rolling on into summer, as one rambles into higher and higher grass.</p>

  <p>Thus was my first year's life in the woods completed; and the second year was
  similar to it. I finally left Walden September 6th, 1847.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>To the sick the doctors wisely recommend a change of air and scenery. Thank Heaven,
  here is not all the world. The buckeye does not grow in New England, and the
  mockingbird is rarely heard here. The wild goose is more of a cosmopolite than we; he
  breaks his fast in Canada, takes a luncheon in the Ohio, and plumes himself for the
  night in a southern bayou. Even the bison, to some extent, keeps pace with the seasons
  cropping the pastures of the Colorado only till a greener and sweeter grass awaits him
  by the Yellowstone. Yet we think that if rail fences are pulled down, and stone walls
  piled up on our farms, bounds are henceforth set to our lives and our fates decided. If
  you are chosen town clerk, forsooth, you cannot go to Tierra del Fuego this summer: but
  you may go to the land of infernal fire nevertheless. The universe is wider than our
  views of it.</p>

  <p>Yet we should oftener look over the tafferel of our craft, like curious passengers,
  and not make the voyage like stupid sailors picking oakum. The other side of the globe
  is but the home of our correspondent. Our voyaging is only great-circle sailing, and
  the doctors prescribe for diseases of the skin merely. One hastens to southern Africa
  to chase the giraffe; but surely that is not the game he would be after. How long,
  pray, would a man hunt giraffes if he could? Snipes and woodcocks also may afford rare
  sport; but I trust it would be nobler game to shoot one's self.&#8212;</p>

  greater to the less. They love the soil which makes their graves, but have no sympathy
  with the spirit which may still animate their clay. Patriotism is a maggot in their
  heads. What was the meaning of that South-Sea Exploring Expedition, with all its parade

  in the moral world to which every man is an isthmus or an inlet, yet unexplored by him,
  but that it is easier to sail many thousand miles through cold and storm and cannibals,
  in a government ship, with five hundred men and boys to assist one, than it is to
  explore the private sea, the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean of one's being alone.</p>

  "Symmes' Hole" by which to get at the inside at last. England and France, Spain and
  Portugal, Gold Coast and Slave Coast, all front on this private sea; but no bark from
  them has ventured out of sight of land, though it is without doubt the direct way to
  India. If you would learn to speak all tongues and conform to the customs of all
  nations, if you would travel farther than all travellers, be naturalized in all climes,
  and cause the Sphinx to dash her head against a stone, even obey the precept of the old
  philosopher, and Explore thyself. Herein are demanded the eye and the nerve. Only the
  defeated and deserters go to the wars, cowards that run away and enlist. Start now on
  that farthest western way, which does not pause at the Mississippi or the Pacific, nor
  conduct toward a worn-out China or Japan, but leads on direct, a tangent to this
  sphere, summer and winter, day and night, sun down, moon down, and at last earth down
  too.</p>

  <p>It is said that Mirabeau took to highway robbery "to ascertain what degree of
  resolution was necessary in order to place one's self in formal opposition to the most
  sacred laws of society." He declared that "a soldier who fights in the ranks does not
  require half so much courage as a footpad"&#8212;"that honor and religion have never
  stood in the way of a well-considered and a firm resolve." This was manly, as the world
  goes; and yet it was idle, if not desperate. A saner man would have found himself often
  enough "in formal opposition" to what are deemed "the most sacred laws of society,"
  through obedience to yet more sacred laws, and so have tested his resolution without
  going out of his way. It is not for a man to put himself in such an attitude to
  society, but to maintain himself in whatever attitude he find himself through obedience
  to the laws of his being, which will never be one of opposition to a just government,
  if he should chance to meet with such.</p>

  <p>I left the woods for as good a reason as I went there. Perhaps it seemed to me that
  I had several more lives to live, and could not spare any more time for that one. It is
  remarkable how easily and insensibly we fall into a particular route, and make a beaten
  track for ourselves. I had not lived there a week before my feet wore a path from my
  door to the pond-side; and though it is five or six years since I trod it, it is still
  quite distinct. It is true, I fear, that others may have fallen into it, and so helped
  to keep it open. The surface of the earth is soft and impressible by the feet of men;
  and so with the paths which the mind travels. How worn and dusty, then, must be the
  highways of the world, how deep the ruts of tradition and conformity! I did not wish to
  take a cabin passage, but rather to go before the mast and on the deck of the world,
  for there I could best see the moonlight amid the mountains. I do not wish to go below
  now.</p>

  <p>I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the
  direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will
  meet with a success unexpected in common hours. He will put some things behind, will
  pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to
  establish themselves around and within him; or the old laws be expanded, and
  interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and he will live with the license of
  a higher order of beings. In proportion as he simplifies his life, the laws of the
  universe will appear less complex, and solitude will not be solitude, nor poverty
  poverty, nor weakness weakness. If you have built castles in the air, your work need
  not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.</p>

  <p>It is a ridiculous demand which England and America make, that you shall speak so
  that they can understand you. Neither men nor toadstools grow so. As if that were
  important, and there were not enough to understand you without them. As if Nature could
  support but one order of understandings, could not sustain birds as well as quadrupeds,
  flying as well as creeping things, and <i>hush</i> and <i>whoa</i>, which Bright can
  understand, were the best English. As if there were safety in stupidity alone. I fear
  chiefly lest my expression may not be <i>extra-vagant</i> enough, may not wander far
  enough beyond the narrow limits of my daily experience, so as to be adequate to the
  truth of which I have been convinced. <i>Extra vagance!</i> it depends on how you are
  yarded. The migrating buffalo, which seeks new pastures in another latitude, is not
  extravagant like the cow which kicks over the pail, leaps the cowyard fence, and runs
  after her calf, in milking time. I desire to speak somewhere <i>without</i> bounds;
  like a man in a waking moment, to men in their waking moments; for I am convinced that
  I cannot exaggerate enough even to lay the foundation of a true expression. Who that
  has heard a strain of music feared then lest he should speak extravagantly any more
  forever? In view of the future or possible, we should live quite laxly and undefined in
  front, our outlines dim and misty on that side; as our shadows reveal an insensible
  perspiration toward the sun. The volatile truth of our words should continually betray
  the inadequacy of the residual statement. Their truth is instantly <i>translated</i>;
  its literal monument alone remains. The words which express our faith and piety are not
  definite; yet they are significant and fragrant like frankincense to superior
  natures.</p>

  <p>Why level downward to our dullest perception always, and praise that as common
  sense? The commonest sense is the sense of men asleep, which they express by snoring.
  Sometimes we are inclined to class those who are once-and-a-half-witted with the
  half-witted, because we appreciate only a third part of their wit. Some would find
  fault with the morning red, if they ever got up early enough. "They pretend," as I
  hear, "that the verses of Kabir have four different senses; illusion, spirit,
  intellect, and the exoteric doctrine of the Vedas"; but in this part of the world it is
  considered a ground for complaint if a man's writings admit of more than one
  interpretation. While England endeavors to cure the potato-rot, will not any endeavor
  to cure the brain-rot, which prevails so much more widely and fatally?</p>

  <p>I do not suppose that I have attained to obscurity, but I should be proud if no more
  fatal fault were found with my pages on this score than was found with the Walden ice.
  Southern customers objected to its blue color, which is the evidence of its purity, as
  if it were muddy, and preferred the Cambridge ice, which is white, but tastes of weeds.
  The purity men love is like the mists which envelop the earth, and not like the azure
  ether beyond.</p>

  <p>Some are dinning in our ears that we Americans, and moderns generally, are
  intellectual dwarfs compared with the ancients, or even the Elizabethan men. But what
  is that to the purpose? A living dog is better than a dead lion. Shall a man go and
  hang himself because he belongs to the race of pygmies, and not be the biggest pygmy
  that he can? Let every one mind his own business, and endeavor to be what he was
  made.</p>

  <p>Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed and in such desperate
  enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he
  hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured
  or far away. It is not important that he should mature as soon as an apple tree or an
  oak. Shall he turn his spring into summer? If the condition of things which we were
  made for is not yet, what were any reality which we can substitute? We will not be
  shipwrecked on a vain reality. Shall we with pains erect a heaven of blue glass over
  ourselves, though when it is done we shall be sure to gaze still at the true ethereal
  heaven far above, as if the former were not?</p>

  <p>There was an artist in the city of Kouroo who was disposed to strive after
  perfection. One day it came into his mind to make a staff. Having considered that in an
  imperfect work time is an ingredient, but into a perfect work time does not enter, he
  said to himself, It shall be perfect in all respects, though I should do nothing else
  in my life. He proceeded instantly to the forest for wood, being resolved that it
  should not be made of unsuitable material; and as he searched for and rejected stick
  after stick, his friends gradually deserted him, for they grew old in their works and
  died, but he grew not older by a moment. His singleness of purpose and resolution, and
  his elevated piety, endowed him, without his knowledge, with perennial youth. As he
  made no compromise with Time, Time kept out of his way, and only sighed at a distance
  because he could not overcome him. Before he had found a stock in all respects suitable
  the city of Kouroo was a hoary ruin, and he sat on one of its mounds to peel the stick.
  Before he had given it the proper shape the dynasty of the Candahars was at an end, and
  with the point of the stick he wrote the name of the last of that race in the sand, and
  then resumed his work. By the time he had smoothed and polished the staff Kalpa was no
  longer the pole-star; and ere he had put on the ferule and the head adorned with
  precious stones, Brahma had awoke and slumbered many times. But why do I stay to
  mention these things? When the finishing stroke was put to his work, it suddenly
  expanded before the eyes of the astonished artist into the fairest of all the creations
  of Brahma. He had made a new system in making a staff, a world with full and fair
  proportions; in which, though the old cities and dynasties had passed away, fairer and
  more glorious ones had taken their places. And now he saw by the heap of shavings still
  fresh at his feet, that, for him and his work, the former lapse of time had been an
  illusion, and that no more time had elapsed than is required for a single scintillation
  from the brain of Brahma to fall on and inflame the tinder of a mortal brain. The
  material was pure, and his art was pure; how could the result be other than
  wonderful?</p>

  <p>No face which we can give to a matter will stead us so well at last as the truth.
  This alone wears well. For the most part, we are not where we are, but in a false
  position. Through an infinity of our natures, we suppose a case, and put ourselves into
  it, and hence are in two cases at the same time, and it is doubly difficult to get out.
  In sane moments we regard only the facts, the case that is. Say what you have to say,
  not what you ought. Any truth is better than make-believe. Tom Hyde, the tinker,
  standing on the gallows, was asked if he had anything to say. "Tell the tailors," said
  he, "to remember to make a knot in their thread before they take the first stitch." His
  companion's prayer is forgotten.</p>

  <p>However mean your life is, meet it and live it; do not shun it and call it hard
  names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you are richest. The
  fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love your life, poor as it is. You may
  perhaps have some pleasant, thrilling, glorious hours, even in a poorhouse. The setting
  sun is reflected from the windows of the almshouse as brightly as from the rich man's
  abode; the snow melts before its door as early in the spring. I do not see but a quiet
  mind may live as contentedly there, and have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace. The
  town's poor seem to me often to live the most independent lives of any. Maybe they are
  simply great enough to receive without misgiving. Most think that they are above being
  supported by the town; but it oftener happens that they are not above supporting
  themselves by dishonest means, which should be more disreputable. Cultivate poverty
  like a garden herb, like sage. Do not trouble yourself much to get new things, whether
  clothes or friends. Turn the old; return to them. Things do not change; we change. Sell
  your clothes and keep your thoughts. God will see that you do not want society. If I
  were confined to a corner of a garret all my days, like a spider, the world would be
  just as large to me while I had my thoughts about me. The philosopher said: "From an
  army of three divisions one can take away its general, and put it in disorder; from the
  man the most abject and vulgar one cannot take away his thought." Do not seek so
  anxiously to be developed, to subject yourself to many influences to be played on; it
  is all dissipation. Humility like darkness reveals the heavenly lights. The shadows of
  poverty and meanness gather around us, "and lo! creation widens to our view." We are
  often reminded that if there were bestowed on us the wealth of Croesus, our aims must
  still be the same, and our means essentially the same. Moreover, if you are restricted
  in your range by poverty, if you cannot buy books and newspapers, for instance, you are
  but confined to the most significant and vital experiences; you are compelled to deal
  with the material which yields the most sugar and the most starch. It is life near the
  bone where it is sweetest. You are defended from being a trifler. No man loses ever on
  a lower level by magnanimity on a higher. Superfluous wealth can buy superfluities
  only. Money is not required to buy one necessary of the soul.</p>

  <p>I live in the angle of a leaden wall, into whose composition was poured a little
  alloy of bell-metal. Often, in the repose of my mid-day, there reaches my ears a
  confused tintinnabulum from without. It is the noise of my contemporaries. My neighbors
  tell me of their adventures with famous gentlemen and ladies, what notabilities they
  met at the dinner-table; but I am no more interested in such things than in the
  contents of the Daily Times. The interest and the conversation are about costume and
  manners chiefly; but a goose is a goose still, dress it as you will. They tell me of
  California and Texas, of England and the Indies, of the Hon. Mr.&#8212;&#8212;of
  Georgia or of Massachusetts, all transient and fleeting phenomena, till I am ready to
  leap from their court-yard like the Mameluke bey. I delight to come to my
  bearings&#8212;not walk in procession with pomp and parade, in a conspicuous place, but
  to walk even with the Builder of the universe, if I may&#8212;not to live in this
  restless, nervous, bustling, trivial Nineteenth Century, but stand or sit thoughtfully
  while it goes by. What are men celebrating? They are all on a committee of
  arrangements, and hourly expect a speech from somebody. God is only the president of
  the day, and Webster is his orator. I love to weigh, to settle, to gravitate toward
  that which most strongly and rightfully attracts me&#8212;not hang by the beam of the
  scale and try to weigh less&#8212;not suppose a case, but take the case that is; to
  travel the only path I can, and that on which no power can resist me. It affords me no
  satisfaction to commerce to spring an arch before I have got a solid foundation. Let us
  not play at kittly-benders. There is a solid bottom everywhere. We read that the
  traveller asked the boy if the swamp before him had a hard bottom. The boy replied that
  it had. But presently the traveller's horse sank in up to the girths, and he observed
  to the boy, "I thought you said that this bog had a hard bottom." "So it has," answered
  the latter, "but you have not got half way to it yet." So it is with the bogs and
  quicksands of society; but he is an old boy that knows it. Only what is thought, said,
  or done at a certain rare coincidence is good. I would not be one of those who will
  foolishly drive a nail into mere lath and plastering; such a deed would keep me awake
  nights. Give me a hammer, and let me feel for the furring. Do not depend on the putty.
  Drive a nail home and clinch it so faithfully that you can wake up in the night and
  think of your work with satisfaction&#8212;a work at which you would not be ashamed to
  invoke the Muse. So will help you God, and so only. Every nail driven should be as
  another rivet in the machine of the universe, you carrying on the work.</p>

  <p>Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth. I sat at a table where were
  rich food and wine in abundance, and obsequious attendance, but sincerity and truth
  were not; and I went away hungry from the inhospitable board. The hospitality was as
  cold as the ices. I thought that there was no need of ice to freeze them. They talked
  to me of the age of the wine and the fame of the vintage; but I thought of an older, a
  newer, and purer wine, of a more glorious vintage, which they had not got, and could
  not buy. The style, the house and grounds and "entertainment" pass for nothing with me.
  I called on the king, but he made me wait in his hall, and conducted like a man
  incapacitated for hospitality. There was a man in my neighborhood who lived in a hollow
  tree. His manners were truly regal. I should have done better had I called on him.</p>

  <p>How long shall we sit in our porticoes practising idle and musty virtues, which any
  work would make impertinent? As if one were to begin the day with long-suffering, and
  hire a man to hoe his potatoes; and in the afternoon go forth to practise Christian
  meekness and charity with goodness aforethought! Consider the China pride and stagnant
  self-complacency of mankind. This generation inclines a little to congratulate itself
  on being the last of an illustrious line; and in Boston and London and Paris and Rome,
  thinking of its long descent, it speaks of its progress in art and science and
  literature with satisfaction. There are the Records of the Philosophical Societies, and
  the public Eulogies of Great Men! It is the good Adam contemplating his own virtue.
  "Yes, we have done great deeds, and sung divine songs, which shall never
  die"&#8212;that is, as long as we can remember them. The learned societies and great
  men of Assyria&#8212;where are they? What youthful philosophers and experimentalists we
  are! There is not one of my readers who has yet lived a whole human life. These may be
  but the spring months in the life of the race. If we have had the seven-years' itch, we
  have not seen the seventeen-year locust yet in Concord. We are acquainted with a mere
  pellicle of the globe on which we live. Most have not delved six feet beneath the
  surface, nor leaped as many above it. We know not where we are. Beside, we are sound
  asleep nearly half our time. Yet we esteem ourselves wise, and have an established
  order on the surface. Truly, we are deep thinkers, we are ambitious spirits! As I stand
  over the insect crawling amid the pine needles on the forest floor, and endeavoring to
  conceal itself from my sight, and ask myself why it will cherish those humble thoughts,
  and bide its head from me who might, perhaps, be its benefactor, and impart to its race
  some cheering information, I am reminded of the greater Benefactor and Intelligence
  that stands over me the human insect.</p>

  <p>There is an incessant influx of novelty into the world, and yet we tolerate
  incredible dulness. I need only suggest what kind of sermons are still listened to in
  the most enlightened countries. There are such words as joy and sorrow, but they are
  only the burden of a psalm, sung with a nasal twang, while we believe in the ordinary
  and mean. We think that we can change our clothes only. It is said that the British
  Empire is very large and respectable, and that the United States are a first-rate
  power. We do not believe that a tide rises and falls behind every man which can float
  the British Empire like a chip, if he should ever harbor it in his mind. Who knows what
  sort of seventeen-year locust will next come out of the ground? The government of the
  world I live in was not framed, like that of Britain, in after-dinner conversations
  over the wine.</p>

  <p>The life in us is like the water in the river. It may rise this year higher than man
  has ever known it, and flood the parched uplands; even this may be the eventful year,
  which will drown out all our muskrats. It was not always dry land where we dwell. I see
  far inland the banks which the stream anciently washed, before science began to record
  its freshets. Every one has heard the story which has gone the rounds of New England,
  of a strong and beautiful bug which came out of the dry leaf of an old table of
  apple-tree wood, which had stood in a farmer's kitchen for sixty years, first in
  Connecticut, and afterward in Massachusetts&#8212;from an egg deposited in the living
  tree many years earlier still, as appeared by counting the annual layers beyond it;
  which was heard gnawing out for several weeks, hatched perchance by the heat of an urn.
  Who does not feel his faith in a resurrection and immortality strengthened by hearing
  of this? Who knows what beautiful and winged life, whose egg has been buried for ages
  under many concentric layers of woodenness in the dead dry life of society, deposited
  at first in the alburnum of the green and living tree, which has been gradually
  converted into the semblance of its well-seasoned tomb&#8212;heard perchance gnawing
  out now for years by the astonished family of man, as they sat round the festive
  board&#8212;may unexpectedly come forth from amidst society's most trivial and
  handselled furniture, to enjoy its perfect summer life at last!</p>

  <p>I do not say that John or Jonathan will realize all this; but such is the character
  of that morrow which mere lapse of time can never make to dawn. The light which puts
  out our eyes is darkness to us. Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is
  more day to dawn. The sun is but a morning star.</p>

  <h2>ON THE DUTY OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE</h2>

  <p>I heartily accept the motto,&#8212;"That government is best which governs least";
  and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out,
  it finally amounts to this, which also I believe,&#8212;"That government is best which
  governs not at all"; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of
  government which they will have. Government is at best but an expedient; but most
  governments are usually, and all governments are sometimes, inexpedient. The objections
  which have been brought against a standing army, and they are many and weighty, and
  deserve to prevail, may also at last be brought against a standing government. The
  standing army is only an arm of the standing government. The government itself, which
  is only the mode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally liable
  to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it. Witness the present
  Mexican war, the work of comparatively a few individuals using the standing government
  as their tool; for, in the outset, the people would not have consented to this
  measure.</p>

  <p>This American government&#8212;what is it but a tradition, though a recent one,
  endeavoring to transmit itself unimpaired to posterity, but each instant losing some of
  its integrity? It has not the vitality and force of a single living man; for a single
  man can bend it to his will. It is a sort of wooden gun to the people themselves. But
  it is not the less necessary for this; for the people must have some complicated
  machinery or other, and hear its din, to satisfy that idea of government which they
  have. Governments show thus how successfully men can be imposed on, even impose on
  themselves, for their own advantage. It is excellent, we must all allow. Yet this
  government never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the alacrity with which it
  got out of its way. <i>It</i> does not keep the country free. <i>It</i> does not settle
  the West. <i>It</i> does not educate. The character inherent in the American people has
  done all that has been accomplished; and it would have done somewhat more, if the
  government had not sometimes got in its way. For government is an expedient by which
  men would fain succeed in letting one another alone; and, as has been said, when it is
  most expedient, the governed are most let alone by it. Trade and commerce, if they were
  not made of India rubber, would never manage to bounce over the obstacles which
  legislators are continually putting in their way; and, if one were to judge these men
  wholly by the effects of their actions, and not partly by their intentions, they would
  deserve to be classed and punished with those mischievous persons who put obstructions
  on the railroads.</p>

  <p>But, to speak practically and as a citizen, unlike those who call themselves
  no-government men, I ask for, not at once no government, but <i>at once</i> a better
  government. Let every man make known what kind of government would command his respect,
  and that will be one step toward obtaining it.</p>

  <p>After all, the practical reason why, when the power is once in the hands of the
  people, a majority are permitted, and for a long period continue, to rule, is not
  because they are most likely to be in the right, nor because this seems fairest to the
  minority, but because they are physically the strongest. But a government in which the
  majority rule in all cases cannot be based on justice, even as far as men understand
  it. Can there not be a government in which majorities do not virtually decide right and
  wrong, but conscience?&#8212;in which majorities decide only those questions to which
  the rule of expediency is applicable? Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the
  least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator? Why has every man a conscience,
  then? I think that we should be men first, and subjects afterward. It is not desirable
  to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only obligation which
  I have a right to assume is to do at any time what I think right. It is truly enough
  said that a corporation has no conscience; but a corporation of conscientious men is a
  corporation with a conscience. Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of
  their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice. A
  common and natural result of an undue respect for law is, that you may see a file of
  soldiers, colonel, captain, corporal, privates, powder-monkeys, and all, marching in
  admirable order over hill and dale to the wars, against their wills, ay, against their
  common sense and consciences, which makes it very steep marching indeed, and produces a
  palpitation of the heart. They have no doubt that it is a damnable business in which
  they are concerned; they are all peaceably inclined. Now, what are they? Men at all? or
  small movable forts and magazines, at the service of some unscrupulous man in power?
  Visit the Navy Yard, and behold a marine, such a man as an American government can
  make, or such as it can make a man with its black arts&#8212;a mere shadow and
  reminiscence of humanity, a man laid out alive and standing, and already, as one may
  say, buried under arms with funeral accompaniments, though it may be,&#8212;</p>
  <pre>           "Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,
               As his corse to the rampart we hurried;
            Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
               O'er the grave where our hero we buried."
</pre>

  <p>The mass of men serve the state thus, not as men mainly, but as machines, with their
  bodies. They are the standing army, and the militia, jailers, constables, posse
  comitatus, etc. In most cases there is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of
  the moral sense; but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth and stones; and
  wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve the purpose as well. Such
  command no more respect than men of straw or a lump of dirt. They have the same sort of
  worth only as horses and dogs. Yet such as these even are commonly esteemed good
  citizens. Others, as most legislators, politicians, lawyers, ministers, and
  office-holders, serve the state chiefly with their heads; and, as they rarely make any
  moral distinctions, they are as likely to serve the devil, without <i>intending</i> it,
  as God. A very few, as heroes, patriots, martyrs, reformers in the great sense, and
  men, serve the state with their consciences also, and so necessarily resist it for the
  most part; and they are commonly treated as enemies by it. A wise man will only be
  useful as a man, and will not submit to be "clay," and "stop a hole to keep the wind
  away," but leave that office to his dust at least:&#8212;</p>
  <pre>          "I am too high-born to be propertied,
           To be a secondary at control,
           Or useful serving-man and instrument
           To any sovereign state throughout the world."
</pre>

  <p>He who gives himself entirely to his fellow-men appears to them useless and selfish;
  but he who gives himself partially to them is pronounced a benefactor and
  philanthropist.</p>

  <p>How does it become a man to behave toward this American government to-day? I answer,
  that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it. I cannot for an instant
  recognize that political organization as <i>my</i> government which is the
  <i>slave's</i> government also.</p>

  <p>All men recognize the right of revolution; that is, the right to refuse allegiance
  to, and to resist, the government, when its tyranny or its inefficiency are great and
  unendurable. But almost all say that such is not the case now. But such was the case,
  they think, in the Revolution of '75. If one were to tell me that this was a bad
  government because it taxed certain foreign commodities brought to its ports, it is
  most probable that I should not make an ado about it, for I can do without them. All
  machines have their friction; and possibly this does enough good to counterbalance the
  evil. At any rate, it is a great evil to make a stir about it. But when the friction
  comes to have its machine, and oppression and robbery are organized, I say, let us not
  have such a machine any longer. In other words, when a sixth of the population of a
  nation which has undertaken to be the refuge of liberty are slaves, and a whole country
  is unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army, and subjected to military law, I
  think that it is not too soon for honest men to rebel and revolutionize. What makes
  this duty the more urgent is the fact that the country so overrun is not our own, but
  ours is the invading army.</p>

  <p>Paley, a common authority with many on moral questions, in his chapter on the "Duty
  of Submission to Civil Government," resolves all civil obligation into expediency; and
  he proceeds to say that "so long as the interest of the whole society requires it, that
  is, so long as the established government cannot be resisted or changed without public
  inconveniency, it is the will of God... that the established government be obeyed, and
  no longer.... This principle being admitted, the justice of every particular case of
  resistance is reduced to a computation of the quantity of the danger and grievance on
  the one side, and of the probability and expense of redressing it on the other." Of
  this, he says, every man shall judge for himself. But Paley appears never to have
  contemplated those cases to which the rule of expediency does not apply, in which a
  people, as well as an individual, must do justice, cost what it may. If I have unjustly
  wrested a plank from a drowning man, I must restore it to him though I drown myself.
  This, according to Paley, would be inconvenient. But he that would save his life, in
  such a case, shall lose it. This people must cease to hold slaves, and to make war on
  Mexico, though it cost them their existence as a people.</p>

  <p>In their practice, nations agree with Paley; but does any one think that
  Massachusetts does exactly what is right at the present crisis?</p>
  <pre>  "A drab of state, a cloth-o'-silver slut,
    To have her train borne up, and her soul trail in the dirt."

  <p class="nind">Practically speaking, the opponents to a reform in Massachusetts are
  not a hundred thousand politicians at the South, but a hundred thousand merchants and
  farmers here, who are more interested in commerce and agriculture than they are in
  humanity, and are not prepared to do justice to the slave and to Mexico, <i>cost what
  it may</i>. I quarrel not with far-off foes, but with those who, near at home,
  co-operate with, and do the bidding of those far away, and without whom the latter
  would be harmless. We are accustomed to say, that the mass of men are unprepared; but
  improvement is slow, because the few are not materially wiser or better than the many.
  It is not so important that many should be as good as you, as that there be some
  absolute goodness somewhere; for that will leaven the whole lump. There are thousands
  who are <i>in opinion</i> opposed to slavery and to the war, who yet in effect do
  nothing to put an end to them; who, esteeming themselves children of Washington and
  Franklin, sit down with their hands in their pockets, and say that they know not what
  to do, and do nothing; who even postpone the question of freedom to the question of
  free-trade, and quietly read the prices-current along with the latest advices from
  Mexico, after dinner, and, it may be, fall asleep over them both. What is the
  price-current of an honest man and patriot to-day? They hesitate, and they regret, and
  sometimes they petition; but they do nothing in earnest and with effect. They will
  wait, well disposed, for others to remedy the evil, that they may no longer have it to
  regret. At most, they give only a cheap vote, and a feeble countenance and Godspeed, to
  the right, as it goes by them. There are nine hundred and ninety-nine patrons of virtue
  to one virtuous man; but it is easier to deal with the real possessor of a thing than
  with the temporary guardian of it.</p>

  <p>All voting is a sort of gaming, like checkers or backgammon, with a slight moral
  tinge to it, a playing with right and wrong, with moral questions; and betting
  naturally accompanies it. The character of the voters is not staked. I cast my vote,
  perchance, as I think right; but I am not vitally concerned that that right should
  prevail. I am willing to leave it to the majority. Its obligation, therefore, never
  exceeds that of expediency. Even voting <i>for the right</i> is <i>doing nothing</i>
  for it. It is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it should prevail. A wise
  man will not leave the right to the mercy of chance, nor wish it to prevail through the
  power of the majority. There is but little virtue in the action of masses of men. When
  the majority shall at length vote for the abolition of slavery, it will be because they
  are indifferent to slavery, or because there is but little slavery left to be abolished
  by their vote. <i>They</i> will then be the only slaves. Only <i>his</i> vote can
  hasten the abolition of slavery who asserts his own freedom by his vote.</p>

  <p>I hear of a convention to be held at Baltimore, or elsewhere, for the selection of a
  candidate for the Presidency, made up chiefly of editors, and men who are politicians
  by profession; but I think, what is it to any independent, intelligent, and respectable
  man what decision they may come to? Shall we not have the advantage of his wisdom and
  honesty, nevertheless? Can we not count upon some independent votes? Are there not many
  individuals in the country who do not attend conventions? But no: I find that the
  respectable man, so called, has immediately drifted from his position, and despairs of
  his country, when his country has more reason to despair of him. He forthwith adopts
  one of the candidates thus selected as the only <i>available</i> one, thus proving that
  he is himself <i>available</i> for any purposes of the demagogue. His vote is of no
  more worth than that of any unprincipled foreigner or hireling native, who may have
  been bought. Oh for a man who is a <i>man</i>, and, as my neighbor says, has a bone in
  his back which you cannot pass your hand through! Our statistics are at fault: the
  population has been returned too large. How many <i>men</i> are there to a square
  thousand miles in this country? Hardly one. Does not America offer any inducement for
  men to settle here? The American has dwindled into an Odd Fellow&#8212;one who may be
  known by the development of his organ of gregariousness, and a manifest lack of
  intellect and cheerful self-reliance; whose first and chief concern, on coming into the
  world, is to see that the almshouses are in good repair; and, before yet he has
  lawfully donned the virile garb, to collect a fund for the support of the widows and
  orphans that may be; who, in short ventures to live only by the aid of the Mutual
  Insurance company, which has promised to bury him decently.</p>

  <p>It is not a man's duty, as a matter of course, to devote himself to the eradication
  of any, even the most enormous wrong; he may still properly have other concerns to
  engage him; but it is his duty, at least, to wash his hands of it, and, if he gives it
  no thought longer, not to give it practically his support. If I devote myself to other
  pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them
  sitting upon another man's shoulders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his
  contemplations too. See what gross inconsistency is tolerated. I have heard some of my
  townsmen say, "I should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection
  of the slaves, or to march to Mexico;&#8212;see if I would go"; and yet these very men
  have each, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by their money,
  furnished a substitute. The soldier is applauded who refuses to serve in an unjust war
  by those who do not refuse to sustain the unjust government which makes the war; is
  applauded by those whose own act and authority he disregards and sets at naught; as if
  the state were penitent to that degree that it hired one to scourge it while it sinned,
  but not to that degree that it left off sinning for a moment. Thus, under the name of
  Order and Civil Government, we are all made at last to pay homage to and support our
  own meanness. After the first blush of sin comes its indifference; and from immoral it
  becomes, as it were, <i>un</i>moral, and not quite unnecessary to that life which we
  have made.</p>

  <p>The broadest and most prevalent error requires the most disinterested virtue to
  sustain it. The slight reproach to which the virtue of patriotism is commonly liable,
  the noble are most likely to incur. Those who, while they disapprove of the character
  and measures of a government, yield to it their allegiance and support are undoubtedly
  its most conscientious supporters, and so frequently the most serious obstacles to
  reform. Some are petitioning the State to dissolve the Union, to disregard the
  requisitions of the President. Why do they not dissolve it themselves&#8212;the union
  between themselves and the State&#8212;and refuse to pay their quota into its treasury?
  Do not they stand in the same relation to the State, that the State does to the Union?
  And have not the same reasons prevented the State from resisting the Union, which have
  prevented them from resisting the State?</p>

  <p>How can a man be satisfied to entertain an opinion merely, and enjoy it? Is there
  any enjoyment in <i>it</i>, if his opinion is that he is aggrieved? If you are cheated
  out of a single dollar by your neighbor, you do not rest satisfied with knowing that
  you are cheated, or with saying that you are cheated, or even with petitioning him to
  pay you your due; but you take effectual steps at once to obtain the full amount, and
  see that you are never cheated again. Action from principle&#8212;the perception and
  the performance of right&#8212;changes things and relations; it is essentially
  revolutionary, and does not consist wholly with anything which was. It not only divides
  states and churches, it divides families; ay, it divides the <i>individual</i>,
  separating the diabolical in him from the divine.</p>

  <p>Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey them, or shall we endeavor to amend
  them, and obey them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress them at once? Men
  generally, under such a government as this, think that they ought to wait until they
  have persuaded the majority to alter them. They think that, if they should resist, the
  remedy would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the government itself that
  the remedy <i>is</i> worse than the evil. <i>It</i> makes it worse. Why is it not more
  apt to anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not cherish its wise minority?
  Why does it cry and resist before it is hurt? Why does it not encourage its citizens to
  be on the alert to point out its faults, and <i>do</i> better than it would have them?
  Why does it always crucify Christ, and excommunicate Copernicus and Luther, and
  pronounce Washington and Franklin rebels?</p>

  <p>One would think, that a deliberate and practical denial of its authority was the
  only offence never contemplated by government; else, why has it not assigned its
  definite, its suitable and proportionate, penalty? If a man who has no property refuses
  but once to earn nine shillings for the State, he is put in prison for a period
  unlimited by any law that I know, and determined only by the discretion of those who
  placed him there; but if he should steal ninety times nine shillings from the State, he
  is soon permitted to go at large again.</p>

  <p>If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government, let
  it go, let it go; perchance it will wear smooth&#8212;certainly the machine will wear
  out. If the injustice has a spring, or a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for
  itself, then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy will not be worse than the
  evil; but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice
  to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be a counter friction to stop the
  machine. What I have to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to the
  wrong which I condemn.</p>

  <p>As for adopting the ways which the State has provided for remedying the evil, I know
  not of such ways. They take too much time, and a man's life will be gone. I have other
  affairs to attend to. I came into this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to
  live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has not everything to do, but
  something; and because he cannot do <i>everything</i>, it is not necessary that he
  should do <i>something</i> wrong. It is not my business to be petitioning the Governor
  or the Legislature any more than it is theirs to petition me; and if they should not
  hear my petition, what should I do then? But in this case the State has provided no
  way; its very Constitution is the evil. This may seem to be harsh and stubborn and
  unconciliatory; but it is to treat with the utmost kindness and consideration the only
  spirit that can appreciate or deserves it. So is an change for the better, like birth
  and death which convulse the body.</p>

  <p>I do not hesitate to say, that those who call themselves Abolitionists should at
  once effectually withdraw their support, both in person and property, from the
  government of Massachusetts, and not wait till they constitute a majority of one,
  before they suffer the right to prevail through them. I think that it is enough if they
  have God on their side, without waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more
  right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one already.</p>

  <p>I meet this American government, or its representative, the State government,
  directly, and face to face, once a year&#8212;no more&#8212;in the person of its
  tax-gatherer; this is the only mode in which a man situated as I am necessarily meets
  it; and it then says distinctly, Recognize me; and the simplest, the most effectual,
  and, in the present posture of affairs, the indispensablest mode of treating with it on
  this head, of expressing your little satisfaction with and love for it, is to deny it
  then. My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal
  with&#8212;for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I
  quarrel&#8212;and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government. How shall
  he ever know well what he is and does as an officer of the government, or as a man,
  until he is obliged to consider whether he shall treat me, his neighbor, for whom he
  has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the
  peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a
  ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action? I know this
  well, that if one thousand, if one hundred, if ten men whom I could name&#8212;if ten
  <i>honest</i> men only&#8212;ay, if <i>one</i> <small>HONEST</small> man, in this State
  of Massachusetts, <i>ceasing to hold slaves</i>, were actually to withdraw from this
  copartnership, and be locked up in the county jail therefor, it would be the abolition
  of slavery in America. For it matters not how small the beginning may seem to be: what
  is once well done is done forever. But we love better to talk about it: that we say is
  our mission. Reform keeps many scores of newspapers in its service, but not one man. If
  my esteemed neighbor, the State's ambassador, who will devote his days to the
  settlement of the question of human rights in the Council Chamber, instead of being
  threatened with the prisons of Carolina, were to sit down the prisoner of
  Massachusetts, that State which is so anxious to foist the sin of slavery upon her
  sister&#8212;though at present she can discover only an act of inhospitality to be the
  ground of a quarrel with her&#8212;the Legislature would not wholly waive the subject
  the following winter.</p>

  <p>Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is
  also a prison. The proper place to-day, the only place which Massachusetts has provided
  for her freer and less desponding spirits, is in her prisons, to be put out and locked
  out of the State by her own act, as they have already put themselves out by their
  principles. It is there that the fugitive slave, and the Mexican prisoner on parole,
  and the Indian come to plead the wrongs of his race, should find them; on that
  separate, but more free and honorable ground, where the State places those who are not
  <i>with</i> her, but <i>against</i> her&#8212;the only house in a slave State in which
  a free man can abide with honor. If any think that their influence would be lost there,
  and their voices no longer afflict the ear of the State, that they would not be as an
  enemy within its walls, they do not know by how much truth is stronger than error, nor
  how much more eloquently and effectively he can combat injustice who has experienced a
  little in his own person. Cast your whole vote, not a strip of paper merely, but your
  whole influence. A minority is powerless while it conforms to the majority; it is not
  even a minority then; but it is irresistible when it clogs by its whole weight. If the
  alternative is to keep all just men in prison, or give up war and slavery, the State
  will not hesitate which to choose. If a thousand men were not to pay their tax-bills
  this year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them,
  and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, in fact, the
  definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible. If the tax-gatherer, or
  any other public officer, asks me, as one has done, "But what shall I do?" my answer
  is, "If you really wish to do anything, resign your office." When the subject has
  refused allegiance, and the officer has resigned his office, then the revolution is
  accomplished. But even suppose blood should flow. Is there not a sort of blood shed
  when the conscience is wounded? Through this wound a man's real manhood and immortality
  flow out, and he bleeds to an everlasting death. I see this blood flowing now.</p>

  <p>I have contemplated the imprisonment of the offender, rather than the seizure of his
  goods&#8212;though both will serve the same purpose&#8212;because they who assert the
  purest right, and consequently are most dangerous to a corrupt State, commonly have not
  spent much time in accumulating property. To such the State renders comparatively small
  service, and a slight tax is wont to appear exorbitant, particularly if they are
  obliged to earn it by special labor with their hands. If there were one who lived
  wholly without the use of money, the State itself would hesitate to demand it of him.
  But the rich man&#8212;not to make any invidious comparison&#8212;is always sold to the
  institution which makes him rich. Absolutely speaking, the more money, the less virtue;
  for money comes between a man and his objects, and obtains them for him; and it was
  certainly no great virtue to obtain it. It puts to rest many questions which he would
  otherwise be taxed to answer; while the only new question which it puts is the hard but
  superfluous one, how to spend it. Thus his moral ground is taken from under his feet.
  The opportunities of living are diminished in proportion as what are called the "means"
  are increased. The best thing a man can do for his culture when he is rich is to
  endeavor to carry out those schemes which he entertained when he was poor. Christ
  answered the Herodians according to their condition. "Show me the tribute-money," said
  he;&#8212;and one took a penny out of his pocket;&#8212;if you use money which has the
  image of C&#230;sar on it, and which he has made current and valuable, that is, <i>if
  you are men of the State</i>, and gladly enjoy the advantages of C&#230;sar's
  government, then pay him back some of his own when he demands it; "Render therefore to
  C&#230;sar that which is C&#230;sar's, and to God those things which are
  God's"&#8212;leaving them no wiser than before as to which was which; for they did not
  wish to know.</p>

  <p>When I converse with the freest of my neighbors, I perceive that, whatever they may
  say about the magnitude and seriousness of the question, and their regard for the
  public tranquillity, the long and the short of the matter is, that they cannot spare
  the protection of the existing government, and they dread the consequences to their
  property and families of disobedience to it. For my own part, I should not like to
  think that I ever rely on the protection of the State. But, if I deny the authority of
  the State when it presents its tax-bill, it will soon take and waste all my property,
  and so harass me and my children without end. This is hard. This makes it impossible
  for a man to live honestly, and at the same time comfortably in outward respects. It
  will not be worth the while to accumulate property; that would be sure to go again. You
  must hire or squat somewhere, and raise but a small crop, and eat that soon. You must
  live within yourself, and depend upon yourself always tucked up and ready for a start,
  and not have many affairs. A man may grow rich in Turkey even, if he will be in all
  respects a good subject of the Turkish government. Confucius said, "If a state is
  governed by the principles of reason, poverty and misery are subjects of shame; if a
  state is not governed by the principles of reason, riches and honors are the subjects
  of shame." No: until I want the protection of Massachusetts to be extended to me in
  some distant Southern port, where my liberty is endangered, or until I am bent solely
  on building up an estate at home by peaceful enterprise, I can afford to refuse
  allegiance to Massachusetts, and her right to my property and life. It costs me less in
  every sense to incur the penalty of disobedience to the State than it would to obey. I
  should feel as if I were worth less in that case.</p>

  <p>Some years ago, the State met me in behalf of the Church, and commanded me to pay a
  certain sum toward the support of a clergyman whose preaching my father attended, but
  never I myself. "Pay," it said, "or be locked up in the jail." I declined to pay. But,
  unfortunately, another man saw fit to pay it. I did not see why the schoolmaster should
  be taxed to support the priest, and not the priest the schoolmaster: for I was not the
  State's schoolmaster, but I supported myself by voluntary subscription. I did not see
  why the lyceum should not present its tax-bill, and have the State to back its demand,
  as well as the Church. However, at the request of the selectmen, I condescended to make
  some such statement as this in writing:&#8212;"Know all men by these presents, that I,
  Henry Thoreau, do not wish to be regarded as a member of any incorporated society which
  I have not joined." This I gave to the town clerk; and he has it. The State, having
  thus learned that I did not wish to be regarded as a member of that church, has never
  made a like demand on me since; though it said that it must adhere to its original
  presumption that time. If I had known how to name them, I should then have signed off
  in detail from all the societies which I never signed on to; but I did not know where
  to find a complete list.</p>

  <p>I have paid no poll-tax for six years. I was put into a jail once on this account,
  for one night; and, as I stood considering the walls of solid stone, two or three feet
  thick, the door of wood and iron, a foot thick, and the iron grating which strained the
  light, I could not help being struck with the foolishness of that institution which
  treated me as if I were mere flesh and blood and bones, to be locked up. I wondered
  that it should have concluded at length that this was the best use it could put me to,
  and had never thought to avail itself of my services in some way. I saw that, if there
  was a wall of stone between me and my townsmen, there was a still more difficult one to
  climb or break through, before they could get to be as free as I was. I did not for a
  moment feel confined, and the walls seemed a great waste of stone and mortar. I felt as
  if I alone of all my townsmen had paid my tax. They plainly did not know how to treat
  me, but behaved like persons who are underbred. In every threat and in every compliment
  there was a blunder; for they thought that my chief desire was to stand the other side
  of that stone wall. I could not but smile to see how industriously they locked the door
  on my meditations, which followed them out again without let or hindrance, and
  <i>they</i> were really all that was dangerous. As they could not reach me, they had
  resolved to punish my body; just as boys, if they cannot come at some person against
  whom they have a spite, will abuse his dog. I saw that the State was half-witted, that
  it was timid as a lone woman with her silver spoons, and that it did not know its
  friends from its foes, and I lost all my remaining respect for it, and pitied it.</p>

  <p>Thus the State never intentionally confronts a man's sense, intellectual or moral,
  but only his body, his senses. It is not armed with superior wit or honesty, but with
  superior physical strength. I was not born to be forced. I will breathe after my own
  fashion. Let us see who is the strongest. What force has a multitude? They only can
  force me who obey a higher law than I. They force me to become like themselves. I do
  not hear of <i>men</i> being <i>forced</i> to have this way or that by masses of men.
  What sort of life were that to live? When I meet a government which says to me, "Your
  money or your life," why should I be in haste to give it my money? It may be in a great
  strait, and not know what to do: I cannot help that. It must help itself; do as I do.
  It is not worth the while to snivel about it. I am not responsible for the successful
  working of the machinery of society. I am not the son of the engineer. I perceive that,
  when an acorn and a chestnut fall side by side, the one does not remain inert to make
  way for the other, but both obey their own laws, and spring and grow and flourish as
  best they can, till one, perchance, overshadows and destroys the other. If a plant
  cannot live according to its nature, it dies; and so a man.</p>

  <p>The night in prison was novel and interesting enough. The prisoners in their
  shirt-sleeves were enjoying a chat and the evening air in the doorway, when I entered.
  But the jailer said, "Come, boys, it is time to lock up"; and so they dispersed, and I
  heard the sound of their steps returning into the hollow apartments. My room-mate was
  introduced to me by the jailer as "a first-rate fellow and a clever man." When the door
  was locked, he showed me where to hang my hat, and how he managed matters there. The
  rooms were whitewashed once a month; and this one, at least, was the whitest, most
  simply furnished, and probably the neatest apartment in the town. He naturally wanted
  to know where I came from, and what brought me there; and, when I had told him, I asked
  him in my turn how he came there, presuming him to be an honest man, of course; and, as
  the world goes, I believe he was. "Why," said he, "they accuse me of burning a barn;
  but I never did it." As near as I could discover, he had probably gone to bed in a barn
  when drunk, and smoked his pipe there; and so a barn was burnt. He had the reputation
  of being a clever man, had been there some three months waiting for his trial to come
  on, and would have to wait as much longer; but he was quite domesticated and contented,
  since he got his board for nothing, and thought that he was well treated.</p>

  <p>He occupied one window, and I the other; and I saw that if one stayed there long,
  his principal business would be to look out the window. I had soon read all the tracts
  that were left there, and examined where former prisoners had broken out, and where a
  grate had been sawed off, and heard the history of the various occupants of that room;
  for I found that even here there was a history and a gossip which never circulated
  beyond the walls of the jail. Probably this is the only house in the town where verses
  are composed, which are afterward printed in a circular form, but not published. I was
  shown quite a long list of verses which were composed by some young men who had been
  detected in an attempt to escape, who avenged themselves by singing them.</p>

  <p>I pumped my fellow-prisoner as dry as I could, for fear I should never see him
  again; but at length he showed me which was my bed, and left me to blow out the
  lamp.</p>

  <p>It was like travelling into a far country, such as I had never expected to behold,
  to lie there for one night. It seemed to me that I never had heard the town-clock
  strike before, nor the evening sounds of the village; for we slept with the windows
  open, which were inside the grating. It was to see my native village in the light of
  the Middle Ages, and our Concord was turned into a Rhine stream, and visions of knights
  and castles passed before me. They were the voices of old burghers that I heard in the
  streets. I was an involuntary spectator and auditor of whatever was done and said in
  the kitchen of the adjacent village-inn&#8212;a wholly new and rare experience to me.
  It was a closer view of my native town. I was fairly inside of it. I never had seen its
  institutions before. This is one of its peculiar institutions; for it is a shire town.
  I began to comprehend what its inhabitants were about.</p>

  <p>In the morning, our breakfasts were put through the hole in the door, in small
  oblong-square tin pans, made to fit, and holding a pint of chocolate, with brown bread,
  and an iron spoon. When they called for the vessels again, I was green enough to return
  what bread I had left; but my comrade seized it, and said that I should lay that up for
  lunch or dinner. Soon after he was let out to work at haying in a neighboring field,
  whither he went every day, and would not be back till noon; so he bade me good-day,
  saying that he doubted if he should see me again.</p>

  <p>When I came out of prison&#8212;for some one interfered, and paid that tax&#8212;I
  did not perceive that great changes had taken place on the common, such as he observed
  who went in a youth and emerged a tottering and gray-headed man; and yet a change had
  to my eyes come over the scene&#8212;the town, and State, and country&#8212;greater
  than any that mere time could effect. I saw yet more distinctly the State in which I
  lived. I saw to what extent the people among whom I lived could be trusted as good
  neighbors and friends; that their friendship was for summer weather only; that they did
  not greatly propose to do right; that they were a distinct race from me by their
  prejudices and superstitions, as the Chinamen and Malays are; that in their sacrifices
  to humanity, they ran no risks, not even to their property; that after all they were
  not so noble but they treated the thief as he had treated them, and hoped, by a certain
  outward observance and a few prayers, and by walking in a particular straight though
  useless path from time to time, to save their souls. This may be to judge my neighbors
  harshly; for I believe that many of them are not aware that they have such an
  institution as the jail in their village.</p>

  <p>It was formerly the custom in our village, when a poor debtor came out of jail, for
  his acquaintances to salute him, looking through their fingers, which were crossed to
  represent the grating of a jail window, "How do ye do?" My neighbors did not thus
  salute me, but first looked at me, and then at one another, as if I had returned from a
  long journey. I was put into jail as I was going to the shoemaker's to get a shoe which
  was mended. When I was let out the next morning, I proceeded to finish my errand, and,
  having put on my mended shoe, joined a huckleberry party, who were impatient to put
  themselves under my conduct; and in half an hour&#8212;for the horse was soon
  tackled&#8212;was in the midst of a huckleberry field, on one of our highest hills, two
  miles off, and then the State was nowhere to be seen.</p>

  <p>This is the whole history of "My Prisons."</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>I have never declined paying the highway tax, because I am as desirous of being a
  good neighbor as I am of being a bad subject; and as for supporting schools, I am doing
  my part to educate my fellow-countrymen now. It is for no particular item in the
  tax-bill that I refuse to pay it. I simply wish to refuse allegiance to the State, to
  withdraw and stand aloof from it effectually. I do not care to trace the course of my
  dollar, if I could, till it buys a man or a musket to shoot one with&#8212;the dollar
  is innocent&#8212;but I am concerned to trace the effects of my allegiance. In fact, I
  quietly declare war with the State, after my fashion, though I will still make what use
  and get what advantage of her I can, as is usual in such cases.</p>

  <p>If others pay the tax which is demanded of me, from a sympathy with the State, they
  do but what they have already done in their own case, or rather they abet injustice to
  a greater extent than the State requires. If they pay the tax from a mistaken interest
  in the individual taxed, to save his property, or prevent his going to jail, it is
  because they have not considered wisely how far they let their private feelings
  interfere with the public good.</p>

  <p>This, then, is my position at present. But one cannot be too much on his guard in
  such a case, lest his action be biased by obstinacy or an undue regard for the opinions
  of men. Let him see that he does only what belongs to himself and to the hour.</p>

  <p>I think sometimes, Why, this people mean well; they are only ignorant; they would do
  better if they knew how: why give your neighbors this pain to treat you as they are not
  inclined to? But I think, again, This is no reason why I should do as they do, or
  permit others to suffer much greater pain of a different kind. Again, I sometimes say
  to myself, When many millions of men, without heat, without ill-will, without personal
  feeling of any kind, demand of you a few shillings only, without the possibility, such
  is their constitution, of retracting or altering their present demand, and without the
  possibility, on your side, of appeal to any other millions, why expose yourself to this
  overwhelming brute force? You do not resist cold and hunger, the winds and the waves,
  thus obstinately; you quietly submit to a thousand similar necessities. You do not put
  your head into the fire. But just in proportion as I regard this as not wholly a brute
  force, but partly a human force, and consider that I have relations to those millions
  as to so many millions of men, and not of mere brute or inanimate things, I see that
  appeal is possible, first and instantaneously, from them to the Maker of them, and,
  secondly, from them to themselves. But, if I put my head deliberately into the fire,
  there is no appeal to fire or to the Maker of fire, and I have only myself to blame. If
  I could convince myself that I have any right to be satisfied with men as they are, and
  to treat them accordingly, and not according, in some respects, to my requisitions and
  expectations of what they and I ought to be, then, like a good Mussulman and fatalist,
  I should endeavor to be satisfied with things as they are, and say it is the will of
  God. And, above all, there is this difference between resisting this and a purely brute
  or natural force, that I can resist this with some effect; but I cannot expect, like
  Orpheus, to change the nature of the rocks and trees and beasts.</p>

  <p>I do not wish to quarrel with any man or nation. I do not wish to split hairs, to
  make fine distinctions, or set myself up as better than my neighbors. I seek rather, I
  may say, even an excuse for conforming to the laws of the land. I am but too ready to
  conform to them. Indeed, I have reason to suspect myself on this head; and each year,
  as the tax-gatherer comes round, I find myself disposed to review the acts and position
  of the general and State governments, and the spirit of the people, to discover a
  pretext for conformity.</p>
  <pre>            "We must affect our country as our parents,
             And if at any time we alienate
             Our love or industry from doing it honor,
             We must respect effects and teach the soul
             Matter of conscience and religion,
             And not desire of rule or benefit."
</pre>

  <p class="nind">I believe that the State will soon be able to take all my work of this
  sort out of my hands, and then I shall be no better a patriot than my
  fellow-countrymen. Seen from a lower point of view, the Constitution, with all its
  faults, is very good; the law and the courts are very respectable; even this State and
  this American government are, in many respects, very admirable and rare things, to be
  thankful for, such as a great many have described them; but seen from a point of view a
  little higher, they are what I have described them; seen from a higher still, and the
  highest, who shall say what they are, or that they are worth looking at or thinking of
  at all?</p>

  <p>However, the government does not concern me much, and I shall bestow the fewest
  possible thoughts on it. It is not many moments that I live under a government, even in
  this world. If a man is thought-free, fancy-free, imagination-free, that which <i>is
  not</i> never for a long time appearing <i>to be</i> to him, unwise rulers or reformers
  cannot fatally interrupt him.</p>

  <p>I know that most men think differently from myself; but those whose lives are by
  profession devoted to the study of these or kindred subjects, content me as little as
  any. Statesmen and legislators, standing so completely within the institution, never
  distinctly and nakedly behold it. They speak of moving society, but have no
  resting-place without it. They may be men of a certain experience and discrimination,
  and have no doubt invented ingenious and even useful systems, for which we sincerely
  thank them; but all their wit and usefulness lie within certain not very wide limits.
  They are wont to forget that the world is not governed by policy and expediency.
  Webster never goes behind government, and so cannot speak with authority about it. His
  words are wisdom to those legislators who contemplate no essential reform in the
  existing government; but for thinkers, and those who legislate for all time, he never
  once glances at the subject. I know of those whose serene and wise speculations on this
  theme would soon reveal the limits of his mind's range and hospitality. Yet, compared
  with the cheap professions of most reformers, and the still cheaper wisdom and
  eloquence of politicians in general, his are almost the only sensible and valuable
  words, and we thank Heaven for him. Comparatively, he is always strong, original, and,
  above all, practical. Still, his quality is not wisdom, but prudence. The lawyer's
  truth is not truth, but consistency or a consistent expediency. Truth is always in
  harmony with herself, and is not concerned chiefly to reveal the justice that may
  consist with wrong-doing. He well deserves to be called, as he has been called, the
  Defender of the Constitution. There are really no blows to be given by him but
  defensive ones. He is not a leader, but a follower. His leaders are the men of '87. "I
  have never made an effort," he says, "and never propose to make an effort; I have never
  countenanced an effort, and never mean to countenance an effort, to disturb the
  arrangement as originally made, by which the various States came into the Union." Still
  thinking of the sanction which the Constitution gives to slavery, he says, "Because it
  was a part of the original compact&#8212;let it stand." Notwithstanding his special
  acuteness and ability, he is unable to take a fact out of its merely political
  relations, and behold it as it lies absolutely to be disposed of by the
  intellect&#8212;what, for instance, it behooves a man to do here in America to-day with
  regard to slavery, but ventures, or is driven, to make some such desperate answer as
  the following, while professing to speak absolutely, and as a private man&#8212;from
  which what new and singular code of social duties might be inferred? "The manner," says
  he, "in which the governments of those States where slavery exists are to regulate it
  is for their own consideration, under their responsibility to their constituents, to
  the general laws of propriety, humanity, and justice, and to God. Associations formed
  elsewhere, springing from a feeling of humanity, or any other cause, have nothing
  whatever to do with it. They have never received any encouragement from me, and they
  never will."</p>

  <p>They who know of no purer sources of truth, who have traced up its stream no higher,
  stand, and wisely stand, by the Bible and the Constitution, and drink at it there with
  reverence and humility; but they who behold where it comes trickling into this lake or
  that pool, gird up their loins once more, and continue their pilgrimage toward its
  fountain-head.</p>

  <p>No man with a genius for legislation has appeared in America. They are rare in the
  history of the world. There are orators, politicians, and eloquent men, by the
  thousand; but the speaker has not yet opened his mouth to speak who is capable of
  settling the much-vexed questions of the day. We love eloquence for its own sake, and
  not for any truth which it may utter, or any heroism it may inspire. Our legislators
  have not yet learned the comparative value of free-trade and of freedom, of union, and
  of rectitude, to a nation. They have no genius or talent for comparatively humble
  questions of taxation and finance, commerce and manufacturers and agriculture. If we
  were left solely to the wordy wit of legislators in Congress for our guidance,
  uncorrected by the seasonable experience and the effectual complaints of the people,
  America would not long retain her rank among the nations. For eighteen hundred years,
  though perchance I have no right to say it, the New Testament has been written; yet
  where is the legislator who has wisdom and practical talent enough to avail himself of
  the light which it sheds on the science of legislation?</p>

  <p>The authority of government, even such as I am willing to submit to&#8212;for I will
  cheerfully obey those who know and can do better than I, and in many things even those
  who neither know nor can do so well&#8212;is still an impure one: to be strictly just,
  it must have the sanction and consent of the governed. It can have no pure right over
  my person and property but what I concede to it. The progress from an absolute to a
  limited monarchy, from a limited monarchy to a democracy, is a progress toward a true
  respect for the individual. Even the Chinese philosopher was wise enough to regard the
  individual as the basis of the empire. Is a democracy, such as we know it, the last
  improvement possible in government? Is it not possible to take a step further towards
  recognizing and organizing the rights of man? There will never be a really free and
  enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and
  independent power, from which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats
  him accordingly. I please myself with imagining a State at least which can afford to be
  just to all men, and to treat the individual with respect as a neighbor; which even
  would not think it inconsistent with its own repose if a few were to live aloof from
  it, not meddling with it, nor embraced by it, who fulfilled all the duties of neighbors
  and fellow-men. A State which bore this kind of fruit, and suffered it to drop off as
  fast as it ripened, would prepare the way for a still more perfect and glorious State,
  which also I have imagined, but not yet anywhere seen.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

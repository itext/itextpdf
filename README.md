************ IMPORTANT NOTE ************

THE ITEXT CORE LIBRARY IS AVAILABLE UNDER TWO LICENSING MODELS:

============ COMMERCIAL LICENSING ============

An iText commercial license provides advantages not available with the open-source AGPL license. Specific benefits include:
Indemnification in the event of IP (intellectual property) or patent infringement
Release from the requirements of the copyleft AGPL license, which include: 
distribution of all source code, including your own product (even for web-based applications)
licensing of your own product under the AGPL license
prominent mention and inclusion of the iText copyright and the AGPL license
disclosure of modifications Release from the requirement to not change the PDF Producer line in the generated PDF properties
Only commercial licensees have access to commercial iText support.

============ THE AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (AGPL) ============

While the AGPL license has no direct financial cost there are clear requirements for AGPL use. Buying a commercial license is mandatory as soon as you develop activities involving the iText software without disclosing the source code of your own applications.
